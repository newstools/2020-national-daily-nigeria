The All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Senator Hope Uzodinma on his victory at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The party expressed its joy  over the Supreme Court’s declaration of Uzodinma as the rightful winner of the 2019 Imo State Governorship election.
APC in a statement on Tuesday by the National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, affirmed that it has never lost faith in the judiciary and chose to focus on that route to reclaim its mandate.
The ruling parry, therefore,  congratulated Hope Uzodinma, supporters and members of APC for their temperance displayed in the aftermath of the election.
The statement read: “Even as we are still wondering why we lost elections we clearly won in Zamfara State at the Supreme Court and how the same court ruled our party out of the electoral race in Rivers State, we have never, as a political party, lost faith in the judiciary.
“We salute Senator Hope Uzodinma, our supporters and members for their temperance displayed in the aftermath of the blatant rigging of the Imo Governorship election. We chose to focus on the judicial route to reclaim the Party’s mandate. We are confident that our other stolen electoral mandates will be restored by the courts.”
APC called on all Imo State party stakeholders to come together in support of Senator Uzodinma to ensure the success of the Party’s Next Level agenda and to democratically entrench the APC in the state and entire South East.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday nullified the election of Emeka Ihedioha and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately issue certificate of return to Senator Uzodinma.
