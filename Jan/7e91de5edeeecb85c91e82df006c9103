The United Nations (UN) has detected that terrorists have more checkpoints in northeast Nigeria than security operatives. The global agency lamented that this makes it easy for the insurgents to abduct and kill aid workers in that part of the country.
The UN accordingly condemned the rate of attacks on aid workers deployed to assist victims of insurgency in the northeast.
UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, had disclosed that 12 aid workers were killed in 2019, lamenting that the figure is twice the record in the previous year.
Kallon was of the view that the killings were easy to be perpetuated because of the hostile environment they carry out their duties. He decried that the level of insecurity in the northeast has been on the rise.
Kallon advocated for firm action by the government to end the activities of insurgents at various checkpoints in the northeast, noting the practice has exposed many innocent citizens to attacks.
