Former National Chairman of the APC John Oyegun has lamented Nigerians are unhappy, and the federal government of President Muhammadu Buhari is to blame.
According to him, the federal government is not addressing what is making “people poorer and unhappy.”
“Why is Nigeria not working? At the risk of being misinterpreted, let me make the point that we have been growing in those 20 years, every year and with every administration,’ he said while speaking at the 17th edition of the Daily Trust Dialogue in Abuja.
But in spite of the growth, Oyegun said, there is hardly a single administration that has not left office unpopular in the past twenty years.
“We have never asked ourselves the question why are our people getting increasingly unhappy with their governors within those 20 years,” he added.
Why he couldn’t provide an answer, he however figured the answers to them pose threats for Nigeria.
“Today, we are beginning to hear rumblings that we didn’t hear before.”
It is not uncommon for party leaders to speak baldly against their government. But it happens when there are bottled up grievances, and the grieving members can’t hold it any longer.
Oyegun and his party fell apart when he wasn’t allowed to sit tight for a second term as the PAC national chairman.
He has since not been happy with his successor and kinsman Adams Oshiomhole.
