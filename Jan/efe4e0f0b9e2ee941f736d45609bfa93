Chelsea have endured some difficult moments as they could not afford to do business in the last summer transfer window due to their hitherto transfer ban.
Meanwhile, the ban has been suspended and almost every Chelsea fan is eager to see the north London club strengthened in the transfer window with some notable proven stars.

Ollie Watkins 17 goals in 27 games is absolutely nothing to be sniffed at as he has been the latest in a long line of smart Brentford signings, and this season he’s topping the goalscoring charts in the second tier National Daily gathered.

Meanwhile, some fans won’t be happy that we’re being linked with 24 year old Championship players rather than exciting 17 year old Brazilian talent, but as we’ve seen with Tammy, top scorers from the second tier can easily step up and make a difference at the top.
