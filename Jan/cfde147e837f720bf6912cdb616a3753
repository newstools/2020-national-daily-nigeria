The wives of slain soldiers who fought to ensure that the country remain as one, will get at least N1 million monthly, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has said.
Lalong said farm implements such as tractors and vans will also be made available to the wives of the Nigerian fallen heroes but charge them to organize themselves into a cooperative so as to access these benefits.
The Governor stated this on Wednesday in Jos, during the activities to mark the annual Armed Forces Remembrance Day.
He said: “In remembrance of our fallen heroes, I have made some commitment to provide tractors, vans, and other farm implements in addition with N1 million monthly to the wives of our slain soldiers.
“The NI million is to mobilize them to kick start a farming business, but we have asked them to organize themselves into a cooperative so as to enable them access these benefits”, Lalong said.
While appreciating the Armed Force, the governor said nothing will be too big for the wives of those who lay down their lives to protect the citizens of their beloved country.
Lalong charged Nigerians to live in peace with one another, saying that is the only way to help soldiers stay out of needles war.
