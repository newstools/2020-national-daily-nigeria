Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka has stated his position on south west governors’ security initiative recently launched in Ibadan.
Code-named Operation Amotekun, or the Western Nigeria Security Network, the outfit has commenced operations in all the six states in the southwest.
Speaking at the “Never Again” conference that took place in Lagos on Monday to commemorate 50 years of the end of the Nigerian civil war, Soyinka described Amotekun as a desirable New Year gift.
According to him, ‘Amotekun’ security outfit has fulfilled the ‘yearning of the people’.
“My second remark is to say thank you a number of public-spirited, humanity-considering governors in this nation, who finally responded to the demand and yearnings of the citizens and produced one organization called Amotekun,” he said.
“This is most unexpected. I had given up on them. It was the most unexpected, but desirable New Year present this nation has ever received.
“Whether you agree or disagree, the point is, the yearning of the people has been fulfilled.”
