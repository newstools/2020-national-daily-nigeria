Former governor of Imo state, Emeka Ihedioha on Wednesday disagreed with the judgment of the Supreme Court which ousted him from office, but he still acted the good loser that he is.
In a statement he signed,  he described the judgment as ‘unfair, unjust and does not reflect the wishes of Imo people.
He, therefore, directed all members of Imo State Expanded Executive Council, and all political appointees to write their handing-over notes and return all government properties in their custody.
‘I urge you to extend to my successor, the same support you gave to me. It is my wish that he will continue on the path we had set for the rebuilding of our state as well as consolidate on the progress and milestones we achieved,’ the statement read in part.
While emphasising his disagreement with the judgeent, he still expressed his mindfulness of democratic principles.
‘As true democrats, Engr Gerald Irona and I have no option but to respect the outcome of that judgement,’ he said.
‘I therefore direct all members of Imo State Expanded Executive Council, and all political appointees to write their handing-over notes and to return all government properties in their custody, forthwith. I shall not be party to pilfering of Government property or funds.
The apex court sacked him Tuesday and declared APC candidate Hope Uzodinma, who came fourth in the March election, winner.
The judgement was based on INEC’s failure to declare results in over 300 polling unit where Uzodinma had lawful votes, according to the judgement of the seven-man panel f the Supreme Court.
