The Boko Haram terrorists in their provocation of insufficient payment, on Monday, rejected N50 million ransom paid by sympathizers of an abducted clergyman, then, beheaded the Pastor, Rev. Lawan Andimi, who is Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria in Michika, Adamawa State.
The terrorists were said to have demanded £2 million (N946 million) for the release of the Pastor. Unfortunately, they were paid N50 million which was said to have angered the Boko Haram terrorists; they, then, proceeded to behead the Pastor who was in their captivity.
The Adamawa State CAN Chairman, Stephen Dami Mamza, was said to have narrated on Tuesday: “Pastor Lawan was beheaded yesterday.
“Negations were still ongoing when they stopped calling. They were offered N50 million but they rejected it.
“They called his wife last week, informing her that they will be beheading him on Saturday but somehow they waited till Monday.
“Also, yesterday, Pastor Dennis Bagauri of the Lutheran Church was killed in Jereng, Mayo-Belwa area of Adamawa State.
“It is now clear that Christians are not protected by the government; we don’t feel like we have a government.”
Meanwhile, the Adamawa State Government was said to have condemned the action of the Boko Haram as barbaric.
Director-General, Media and Communication to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, Solomon Kumangar, was said to have noted that, “the governor is saddened by the gruesome execution of the pastor.”
Report indicated that Andimi was abducted two weeks ago when Boko Haram fighters stormed Michika Town in search of foodstuff and other basic items.
