Imo State may be going into another round of crisis as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday, called for election in the constituencies of the lawmakers who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), declaring that party members that defected to APC have lost their seats since they were elected into the legislature on the platform of the PDP. The declaration was made after the PDP national leadership received reports that some members of the Imo State House of Assembly elected on the platform of the party have abdicated the mandate they hold on the pedestal of the party, to defect to the APC, ostensibly for their very selfish gains.
The PDP in a statement on Wednesday by Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary, described such action as unpatriotic and an unpardonable betrayal of the people of their respective constituencies who chose and identified with the ideal and visions of the PDP as the platform for their representation at the state assembly.
“The defectors have, indeed, shown absolute lack of character, failure of leadership capacity in moments of challenges and absence of faith to stand with the people in their most trying moment, but are easily bought by personal pecuniary and political interests.,” PDP declared
The PDP held that these defectors are fully aware of the grave implication of their actions to the effect that by their defection to the APC, they have automatically lost their seats and membership of the Imo State House of Assembly, insisting that they can only hold such position on the mandate of the party on which they were elected;.
“It is settled under the 1999 Constitution (as amended), that a legislator who decamps from a party upon which he was elected a member of a legislative house automatically losses his or her membership of that house as the seat belongs to the political party upon which platform the election was won and not the individual.
“The vacation of seat, as a direct consequence of decamping to another political party other than the party upon which one was elected to occupy a seat in the legislature, is clear and unambiguous under section 109 (1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).
“For the avoidance of doubt, section 109 (1)(g) provides that “a member of the House of Assembly SHALL VACATE his seat in the House if …(g) being a person whose election to the House of Assembly by a political party, he becomes a member of another political party before the expiration of the period for which that House was elected:
“The Constitution went further to state “provided that his membership of the latter political party is not as a result of a division in the political party of which he was previously a member or of a merger of two or more political parties or factions by one of which he was previously sponsored.”
“Consequent upon the above constitutional provisions, these defectors have vacated their seats, they no longer have a place in the state assembly, as there is no division or merger of any kind in the PDP at any level whatsoever, PDP further declared.
The Party maintained that it is, therefore, left with no other option than to request the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately commence the processes for the conduct of fresh elections into the respective state constituencies where the legislators have vacated their seats, in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution.
The PDP called on its teeming members and supporters in Imo State to remain calm and focused at this trying time, adding that the national leadership is proceeding with arrangements ahead of fresh elections in the affected constituencies.
Moreover, the national leadership assured the people of Imo State that processes are already on towards achieving a judicial review and reversal of the defective judgment of the Supreme Court, on the Imo State governorship election.
