A PDP governor has joined forces with the embattled  Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo who is facing challenges in his bid to secure a second term ticket on the platform of the ruling APC.
Ebonyi Gov David Umahi insisted Friday those plotting against Obaseki will fail.
“Power belongs to God and no matter what anybody will do it is God that has the final say and I can assure you Ma, you know as an apostle of the most high God I also prophesy,” Umahi while address wives of southerner governors who visited him on Friday.
“And because of the good work, your husband is doing for the people of Edo State no man can unseat him,” he old Edo’s First Lady Betsy.
According to him, when Obaseki speaks, you see economics, you see a man that came from private sector background.
“And so, we can’t wish that away. So, congratulations to you in advance and to all of us.”
APDP BoT member Daisy Danjuma recently endorsed Obaseki fro a second term, despite arty difference.
Obaseki’s party’s National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole has been in a war of attrition with the governor for over a year now.
Many believe he is working against the re-election of the governor.
