The EFCC  Acting Chairman Ibrahim Magu has expressed near frustration in the fight against corruption in Nigeria.
Magu said this in Calabar on Thursday during a workshop for Community Based Organisations on Whistle Blowing and Fight Against Corruption in Nigeria, organised by the African Center for Media and Information Literacy (AFRICMIL).
Magu, who was represented by Mrs Theresa Nwosu, Head, Public Affairs Department of the Commission, Uyo Office said “Corruption has defied every solution thrown at it and is still spreading like cancer.
“Nigerians must come to the realisation that they are the ones that suffer more if it is allowed to continue to fester”.
He said EFCC cannot be everywhere at the same time, but there were Nigerians in all parts of the country who should give credible information to the commission.
According to him, one of the core mandates of the commission is not just to arrest and prosecute corrupt Nigerians but to ensure prevention of corrupt practices.
“It is important to note that prevention can only be enhanced through sensitisation because a lot of people are unaware and ignorant of the dangers of corruption to the nation.
“Nigeria has just one problem, corruption, but if it is sincerely dealt with every other thing will naturally fall into place.” He added.
He stressed that the whistle blowers policy had really helped the commission in the anti-corruption war, adding that it was very possible for someone to be a whistle blower without any other person knowing.
