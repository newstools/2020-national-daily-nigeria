A man in Anambra who killed his brother in order to inherit is property has bee arrested by the state’s police command. And the property is an iPhone 11.
Paul, 26-year-old, made the confession while being interviewed by newsmen in the state police command.
He said he murdered–by poisoning with Sniper– his elder brother because he could not afford to buy the phone and also because his friends were constantly mocking him.
His mother, however, would not want to press charges as she doesn’t lose two sons at about the same time.
