The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at its 87th National Executive Committee (NEC) in Abuja on Friday declared its rejection of the destruction of democratic institutions and values in Nigeria, especially, the independence of the legislature, the politicization of the judiciary and the compromising of security and electoral institutions.
The party in a communiqué Issued at the end of the 87th National Executive Committee (NEC) on Friday assured Nigerians that it will protect and defend democracy and its institutions in the country
The PDP noted with pains, the gross abuse of the rule of law, the muzzling of civil society and advocates of free speech as well as ordinary Nigerians by the present government.
The PDP totally condemned the utter desecration of judicial tenets and values, climaxing in the national embarrassment of the Supreme Court’s manufacturing of votes and donating same to the APC and its candidate, Hope Uzodimma, thereby, robbing the people of Imo state, of the mandate freely given to Hon. Emeka Ihedioha as their governor.
The PDP observed that the calculated injustice perpetuated by the Supreme Court has proven that the judiciary under Justice Tanko Mohammed is no longer the last hope of the common man but rather the LOST HOPE of the common man in Nigeria.
“The Supreme Court by its judicial summersault has eroded the faith and confidence, which Nigerians have in participatory election, thereby, showcasing that there will be no need for election in the future,” the PDP declared.
The PDP declared that it stands with the people of Imo State and Emeka Ihedioha in all steps being taken to reverse the injustice and reclaim the governorship mandate stolen through the Supreme Court.
The PDP assured Nigerians that, the party, through all available constitutional and legitimate means, including civil disobedience, will insist that this government must respect the rule of law and desist from influencing the judiciary, INEC and security agencies.
“The PDP will not allow the judiciary, security agencies and other institutions of governance to become departments of the APC,” the party declared.
