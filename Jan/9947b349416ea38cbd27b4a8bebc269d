The United Bank for Africa is offering prospective candidates for the 2020/2021 Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination a discounted price for the JAMB registration e-pin obtained at any of its branches across the federation or through any of its e-channels.
The JAMB UTME registration which started on Monday, the 13th of January, 2020 and is expected to close by February 20, is officially N4700 with the registration form going for N3,500, CBT Centre registration fee is N700 while the JAMB mandatory textbook is N500, totaling N4,700
But according to a post on UBA Facebook page, the bank is offering the e-pin at just N3,900.
“Get your JAMB e-pin at a discount at any UBA branch nationwide or via LEO, Mobile Banking and Internet Banking by clicking on Bill Payments,” the post reads.
At the moment eleven banks are selling the e-pin, including Access, FBN, JAIZ, Polaris, Stanbic  IBTC, Sterling, Union and Unity banks among others, but none is offering this discount to candidates.
