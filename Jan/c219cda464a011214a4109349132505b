The Nigerian Music scene of 2019 was definitely not short of memorable moments for music lovers. Artistes released back to back hits which got us on our dancing feet. We got hits from established stars, and emerging stars also gave us great music which we truly enjoyed.

As usual, three of Nigeria’s best perfomers, Wizkid, Davido, and Burnaboy, gave us hits and EPs/albums that fans grooved to: Wizkid with Soundman, Davido’s A Good Time and Burnaboy’s African Giant.

But it wasn’t to be any of these three acts that mesmerised us the most. It was to be Naira Marley who blew our minds with his music and his growing fan cult called “Marlians”. Naira Marley proved to us that no publicity is bad publicity.

Despite his arrest by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on allegations of Cyber Fraud, Naira Marley gave us several hits over the course of 2019 including ike Opotoyi, Am I a Yahoo Boy?, Soapy, Tesumole, Mafo, PXTA. He was also featured on other hit songs which he did Justice to.

It was not just about his songs, Naira Marley also brought a new wave, a movement which many Youths became a part of. “Marlians” they are called, and they take pride in not wearing belts, referring themselves to as “No Belt Gang”. Naira Marley also brought in a new dance step, Tesumole, towards the end of the Year. He also released his EP, LOL.

Naira Marley has won the heart of many, even those who initially resisted to later become Marlians. And there was no better way for Naira Marley to close his 2019 than with his sold-out concert, “Marlian Fest”, which held on the 30th of December at the Eko Convention Centre.

Naira Marley has surely had a fantastic 2019, and he’ll surely be looking at consolidating on the giant strides he made in the Year 2020.
