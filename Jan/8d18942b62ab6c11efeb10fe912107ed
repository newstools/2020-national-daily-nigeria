The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Damaturu, Yobe State, has expressed disappointment and sadness over reports that Leah Sharibu has given birth to a baby boy while being held hostage by the Boko Haram terrorists in the northeast Nigeria.\
The news that Leah gave birth to a baby boy in the Boko Haram den broke out at the weekend, compounding the trauma of the Christian community in Nigeria and Leah’s family and hometown in Yobe State.
Reports indicated that a clergy in Damaturu, Rt. Reverend Yohana Audu, expressed his sadness over the news of Leah giving birth to a child in her captivity. He decried that the traumatic occurrence shows the failure of the government to secure her release long ago.   Rev, Audu, however, still anticipates the safe and prompt return of Leah Sharibu.
The Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Yobe State, Reverend Bright Ogbasiegbe, had also lamented CAN members are disappointed about latest information on Leah giving birth to a child in captivity. The CAN State Secretary demanded thorough investigation. He, however, prayed for safe and quick return of Leah.
The Christian community in Yobe State are not giving up on her return; the community demanded the Federal Government to intensify efforts to secure the release of Leah sharibu.
Leah Sharibu was abandoned by the federal government rescue team who negotiated the release of the Dapchi schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram because of her Christian faith which they said she refused to renounce, while all the Muslim converts were set free.
