Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Progressive Party has been removed by a Federal High Court in Abuja.
Presiding Justice Bello Kawu declined Ubah’s request to set aside the earlier order issued in a judgment the court delivered on April 11, 2019.
Then, Kawu had, in a judgment, sacked Ubah for submitting a forged National Examination Council (NECO) certificate, to contest the February 23, 2019 senatorial election.
The judge also ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Ubah.
PDP’s candidate Obinna Uzoh who came second at the election would now be issued a fresh certificate of return, according the court.
Ubah, a businessman, is the only candidate of the new-generation party t have won anything in 2019 general election.
