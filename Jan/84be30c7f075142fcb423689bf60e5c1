Omoyele Sowore, leader of RevolutionNow Movement who was recently released from the State Security Service (SSS) detention, is at it again. He has taken up fresh struggle against Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over the continuous detention of Agba Jalingo. Sowore blasted the governor and minister that Jalingo is being detained for demanding transparency and accountability in the management of the resources of Cross River State. He, therefore, advocated that the government should free Jalingo now, thus, launching a #freeAgbaJalingo campaign.
Sowore on his twitter handle @YeleSowore-1d wrote: “Agba Jalingo remains jailed by the special machinations(s) of Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River State working in tandem with the ADF of tyranny, Abubakar Malami. Agba’s only crime was his request to have full transparency and accountability in the mgt of the state funds.”
#FreeAgbaJalingo.
