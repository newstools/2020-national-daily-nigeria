A woman found with 15th pregnancy has been banned from by the federal government, The ban came after the woman had given birth to 44 children.
Report indicated that the woman, Mariam Nabatanzi, got married at age of 12 to a 40-year-old man in Uganda. She gave birth to twins a year after. It was noted that due to a genetic condition that led her to have unusually large ovaries that produced multiple eggs per cycle, Mariam had plenty of babies per pregnancy.
She gave birth to a total of six sets of twins, four sets of triplets, and five sets of quadruplets. She had a total of 15 pregnancies which had multiple births that resulted in a total of 44 babies. Mariam lost six babies in childbirth but had to take care of the rest of her 38 children.
Doctors had  to ban Mariam from getting pregnant again.
Acknowledging that the ban is for her own good, Mariam felt happy that she is finally free. She admitted that she had asked doctors to help her out after the first few pregnancies, but she was told that birth control pills might lead to other health complications because of her genetic condition.
