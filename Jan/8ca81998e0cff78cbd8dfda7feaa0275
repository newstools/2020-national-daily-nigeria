There have series of attempts by Manchester United to wrap up the transfer of the Sporting and Portugal midfielder Fernandes to Old Trafford all month, but the saga has dragged on into the final week of the transfer window
Fernandes’ transfer to United is imminent
Last week it appeared the deal had collapsed over financial differences between the two clubs, but the latest reports from Portugal suggest the transfer is back on – and very close to being completed.
However, United fans have reasons to celebrate as the report reaching National Daily on Monday from O Jogo claims that only the final details need to be ironed out ahead of the transfer being signed off, with the move ‘imminent’ and Fernandes himself already preparing to leave his homeland for England.
Solskjaer has remained keen to bring creativity to United’s midfield
Sporting were initially demanding an upfront payment of around £50m, though it appears they are now willing to compromise and will agree to the Red Devils offer, which is worth £46m upfront and a further £13m in add-ons National Daily further learnt.
Fernandes has continued to appear for Sporting during the transfer saga with each new fixture allegedly his last match for the Portuguese outfit.
However, it seems he is finally set for his real farewell appearance on Monday evening, with Sporting hosting Maritimo in the Primeira Liga.
Sporting’s next match is not until Sunday, so if Fernandes plays that game at Braga he has missed out on the chance of leaving this transfer window and will have to see out the season with his current club, before securing a move elsewhere in the summer.
