Singer Wizkid and Genevieve Nnaji seem to be kick-starting something that looks very much like what Tiwa Savage had with the singer.

A look at their Twitter handle sees both celebs showing open love to each other.

Wizkid is widely known as a ladies man, but recent happenings have seen him move from just being that to being a man loved by women older than him.

It all started with rumors of an affair with singer Tiwa Savage with both of them now graduating to an open shown of their affection for each other.

Then came Jada Pollock, Wizkid’s US manager who gave birth to his third son named Zion.

Since then, it’s been love from many older women who are mostly celebrities.

Some of those who have been captured cuddling and showing Wizkid love include Genevieve Nnaji, Moesha Boduong, Damilola Adegbite, Osas Ighodalo, Dillish Mathews etc.
