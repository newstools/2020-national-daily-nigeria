Acquires two new aircraft for Ibom Air

Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has continued to deepen the development of the state economy with investments and new job opportunities. The governor approved the acquisition of two new aircraft for the Ibom Airlines by the State Government. The new acquisition increased the number of aircraft of the Airline to five functioning aircraft owned by the state government.
Governor Udom Emmanuel set the trail blazing in making Akwa Ibom the first state in Nigeria to own and operate an airline.
It was gathered that Chairman of Ibom Air, Air Commodore Idongesit Nkanga (rtd), at a press conference in Uyo, disclosed that the new aircraft would be unveiled in January.
He revealed that Ibom Air made about 3,000 flights since it commenced operations in June 2019: now extending flying to more routes.
The projected that before 2023, the state would float 10 aircraft, maintaining that the state government invested much in the aviation business to boost Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) through returns from investments.
Nkanga declared: “Within these eight months, we will have five aircraft. Towards the end of last year, possibly by October, we are expecting to add about two more aircraft to the existing three. We did that because it was towards the Yuletide and we expected more people to travel. But there was a little delay.
“Additional two aircraft are arriving this January. Within these eight months, we will have five aircraft. We have operated about 3,000 flight. We have increased our routes, because when we first started, it was Uyo to Lagos and Uyo to Abuja.
We have since added Abuja to Lagos and Lagos to Abuja. “We have done enough to make on time departure and we have made about 97percent on time departure.
“Before the end of this administration, we should be able to acquire 10 aircraft. That is the target, before 2022 we should expand the domestic, regional and international routes.”
