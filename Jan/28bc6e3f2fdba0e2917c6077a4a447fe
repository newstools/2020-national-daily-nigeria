Some politicians and other stakeholders in Bauchi are having ‘sleepless nights’ as they await the outcome of Supreme Court verdict on the governorship election, to be delivered on Monday.
The level of anxiety, as well as optimism by both sides are being reflected on daily basis in political programmes aired by radio stations across the state.
Alhaji Uba Nana, Chairman of the APC in the state, said his party had embarked on a prayer session ahead of the Supreme Court verdict.
Nana, who reserved all comments till after the judgement, said the party was hoping for a successful outcome at the apex court. “We are reserving our comments until after the verdict on Monday; we have nothing much to say but I can tell you that we are very prayerful now,” Nana said.
Alhaji Yayanuwa Zainabari, Publicity Secretary of PDP in the state, also said that his party had absolute trust in the Supreme Court and believed that justice would not only be done, but would be seen to have been done.
“We have trust that the court would do justice in delivering its judgement; we have no fear at all and just as we won the election without rigging, by God’s grace, we will have course to celebrate,” he said.
It would be recalled the incumbent governor, Bala Mohammed of PDP, had himself told newsmen shortly after his victory at the Appeal Court in Jos that he could not sleep a day to the Jos verdict.
The governor is now in United Kingdom on medical checkups, according to an earlier statement by his Media Aide, Muktar Gidado.
He said security men in all strategic locations within the state had been placed on the alert, adding that the command had also invited stakeholders of both parties for a dialogue.
He said that members of the two parties had been barred from any form of celebration after the judgement to prevent breakdown of law and order Kamal called on the people of the state to accept whatever the judgement would be as the will of God.
