The Supreme court created governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, and his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), on Monday, sponsored party supporters in Owerri, Imo State capital, to counter the protest of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of the fraudulent judgement of the Supreme Court which calculated non-election figures to declare Uzodinma winner of the governorship election in Imo State.
Supporters of Hope Uzodinma and the APC were said to have trooped out in groups to counter the protest organized by the PDP in Owerri on Monday. Stakeholders in the state were perturbed about the sponsored protest by the Imo State APC and the controversial; Governor to strike a balance.
PDP leaders and supporters held mass protest in many states of Nigeria, including Katsina State, the homer of President Muhammadu Buhari, agitating the Supreme Court judgment that made Uzodinma governor without winning election.
