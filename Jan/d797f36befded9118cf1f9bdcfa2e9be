A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Charles Idahosa, has revealed a plot by the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole to dump the national leader of APC, Bola Tinubu ahead of the 2023 presidential election.
Idahosa in a recent interview alleged that Adams Oshiomhole was plotting to be the running mate of a Northern presidential candidate in 2023 as against the ambition of Tinubu, who many sees as his benefactor.
Idahosa made the allegation while warning Tinubu to be careful of those he sees as friends in the build-up to the 2023 presidential election, insisting that Oshiomhole will team up with a Northerner to work against Tinubu.
He said: “I feel so sorry for Tinubu because he doesn’t know who Oshiomhole is. I am aware he is one of those giving him support as the National chairman.
“Oshiomhole will disappoint him seriously. He will not support him in 2023, he can take that to the bank. Tinubu is one of the people supporting him as National chairman thinking that Oshiomhole will use his influence as National chairman to make him get the ticket.
”What he doesn’t know is that Oshiomhole’s ambition is to become Vice- President to a northern presidential candidate in 2023. He is going to pair a northern candidate against the interest of Tinubu.”
