Reports just reaching National Daily reveal that Manchester United have finally made a breakthrough in their attempts to sign Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes.
Bruno Fernandes has remained United’s top transfer target
The above latest report has left United fans in ecstasy considering the numerous failed attempts to secure Fernandes transfer from the summer last transfer window. The Portuguese international has remained a top transfer target for United as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has remained keen to inject some creativity into team by way of boosting United’s midfield.
National Daily further gathered from the claim by Plataforma that there has been a breakthrough with a compromise on the horizon.
United have suffered several setbacks with their pursuit of Fernandes from last summer transfer window
The transfer has experienced some hiccups as Sporting were demanding a total of £60million (€70m), which could be £51m (€60m) up front and £8.5m (€10m) in bonuses while United were only said to be willing to offer £42.6m (€50m) plus £8.5m (€10m) in bonuses though.
The latest reports claim the Red Devils have got back in touch with Sporting and showed a renewed willingness to get a deal done following the news of Marcus Rashford’s injury.
The striker could be out for around three months with a double stress fracture of his back.
Rashford’s absence has convinced Ed Woodward and Solskjaer they must add Fernandes to their ranks before the January 31 transfer deadline.
The reports now say the transfer will go through for an initial £47m (€55m) with bonuses on top of that.
