But their 1-0 victory couldn’t see them through the next stage as they fell to City 3 -2, aggregrate score.

Ediale analysed the game and gave us the stragegy that worked for Manchester United.

Here he wrote:

Ole is tactical.

The good thing for pep was possession. But Ole had a plan. And it was visible:

— Prevent City from scoring.

— Reduce the number of long clear outs, so it doesnt end up adding to City’s possessions.

— Clip Man City wings by doubling the Left Back. They played Shawn and James as LB. That tamed Mahrez. They knew ‘bisaka will handle Sterling.

— And they congested the front of their box 18.

It was a very webby formation for United. Even at one man down. It seemed they were more than United.

They would have gotten their second goal and take their chances on the Penalty Shootouts if Matic didn’t get a Red Card. That was Ole’s few deficiencies. He should have removed Matic before the second yellow card.

I knew Matic would get the Red Card.

Man City didn’t deserve to qualify. They were playfully wasteful the few times they had clear chances to score. Sterling deserved flogging, Gundogan and the rest of the attacking players deserved frong jump. They were a mess.

And shout out to United’s goalie. David De Gea was a superman.

But Manchester City will proceed to the Carabao Cup final. United only won the show and not the game, despite beating City 1-0. If only they thought about this strategy in the first leg at their home.

Guardiola managed to keep the ball. Congrats to the Citizens.
