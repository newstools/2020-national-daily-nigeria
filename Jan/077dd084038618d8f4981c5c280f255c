The local government chairmen sacked by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo state, have refused to obey the court injunction restraining them from forcefully takeover of secretariats in the state, vowing to continue in office.
Recall that Makinde had immediately after winning the governorship election in 2019 suspended the 33 local government council as well as the 35 LCDA, appointing caretaker committees to run the affairs of the council.
An Oyo State High Court, on Tuesday, granted the wish of the state government, restraining the sacked chairmen and also the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami as well as the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu.
Chairman of the dissolved Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye in a statement on Tuesday, said it was a fact that there cannot be a restraining order for an action that had already been completed.
Abass-Aleshinloye said, “It is unfortunate that the State continues to embark on an exercise in futility. Our people have resumed office since Friday 24 and Monday 27, January, 2020 and they (State Government) claimed to have an order of restrain procured today, Tuesday January 28, 2020.
“Meanwhile that order has not been served on anyone and if eventually served on anyone, it is of no legal effect. Is it possible to restrain an action that has already been completed?”
 
“Let all and sundry be informed that we have not been served with any such order and/or process in any fresh suit. We will like to state the following for the purpose of record. We were never removed from office in pursuance of any Order and there is no law that can be employed in aid of an illegality that will stand in a constitutional democracy.
“Hundreds of witnesses abound to testify about the resumption including the Nigeria Police, Oyo State Commissioner of Police, Mr Shina Olukolu, Division Police Officers (DPO) of various divisions as instructed by the Inspector General of Police to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court Judgment, Local government staff, Peoples democratic Party (PDP) members and the thugs they procured to cause a breach of peace in some Council Areas as well as witnessed by several other citizens of Oyo State.
“It is therefore patently clear that any purported order even if true and if eventually served, can only be an order in futility.”
