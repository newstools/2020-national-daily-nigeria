As tension rose in the lead-up to local governed elections in the state, aggrieved members of the PDP have embarked on sabotage.
The party’s office in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, was early Saturday set ablaze.
It was gathered that many aspirants in Nsukka Council Area have been voicing concerns over alleged hijack of the process by the party hierarchy and its favorite.
Fabian Onah, PDP chairman in Nsukka LGA, confirmed the incident.
He said, “The target was my office as everything in my office was destroyed by fire.
“All the chairs, tables, documents and other office equipment were destroyed.”
According to him, the arsonists scaled the party office, broke up the window blinds, poured petrol, and torched the office.
“I wonder what the intention of those behind putting the PDP office on fire is.
