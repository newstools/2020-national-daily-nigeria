Femi Fani-Kayode, former minister of aviation has condemned the bomb attack in Gamboru, Borno State by suspected Boko Haram members.
Recall that no fewer than 38 corpses were counted as at Tuesday morning with more than 30 others injured in Gamboru Ngala following a bomb explosion targeted at people returning home from the market at the foot of the bridge linking Nigeria and Cameroon Republic.
According to Goni Malam Usman, a leader of the Nigerian community who fled Gamboru to settle in the Cameroonian side, the bomb detonated at around 3:00p.m when civilian JTF both on the Nigeria and Cameroon side were controlling crowd at the bridge.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Fani-Kayode described the sad incident as a ‘horrific example of the bloodfest instigated by the proponents and supporters of Islamist terror and their enablers, friends and protectors in the Buhari government.’
“Yesterday 30 Nigerians were bombed to death by Boko Haram in Borno state. This was yet another horrific example of the bloodfest that the proponents and supporters of Islamist terror and their enablers, friends and protectors in the Buhari government have inflicted on Nigeria. RIP,” he wrote.
