The National Universities Commission (NUC) says it has unbundled Mass Communication into seven separate degree programmes to meet present demand and this takes effect from 2020 admissions into Nigerian universities.
In a chat with journalists in Abuja, NUC’s Executive Secretary, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, said Mass Communication has been unbundled into Media Studies, Public Relation Studies, Cinematography, among others.
Recall that professors, professionals and practitioners of communication in Nigeria had presented new communication curricula to National Universities Commission (NUC) seeking the unbundling of mass communication into seven departments.
The NUC had approved the Curriculum which resulted in the emergence of seven degree-awarding programmes and the phasing out of the single BSc/BA Degree Programme in Mass Communication currently offered in different Faculties in different universities.
The seven new Programmes/Departments, to be domiciled in a Faculty / School / College of Communication and Media Studies are: Journalism & Media Studies, Public Relations, Advertising, Broadcasting, Film & Multi-Media Studies, Development Communication Studies, Information & Media Studies.
