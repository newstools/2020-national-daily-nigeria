The former Athletic Bilbao was sacked as Barcelona’s manager after more than two years in charge, but he harbours no hard feelings towards the club.

In a message that was made available on Barcelona’s official website, Valverde thanked the club’s board for giving him the opportunity to manage an illustrious club like Barcelona.

He also thanked the players with whom he won four trophies during his time at Camp Nou. The 55-year-old won two consecutive La Liga titles, one Copa Del Rey and one Super Cup.  He managed 145 games for Barcelona, winning 96, drawing 35 and losing just 16.

Valverde’s statement on Barcelona’s official website read:  My time as FC Barcelona coach has come to an end. It has been an intense two and a half years right from the start. In that time I have enjoyed some joyful moments celebrating victories and trophies but also others that have been tough and difficult. However, above all, I would like to highlight my experience with the fans and the affection showed towards me during my time as coach.

I would like to thank the president Josep Maria Bartomeu and the Board of Directors for giving me the opportunity to coach the first team and their confidence during all this time. I would also like to thank all the people I have worked with at the Club for their support and how they treated me during the two and a half seasons, especially those who work in and around the first team and with whom I have shared so many moments at the Ciutat Esportiva and during away trips. Of course, I would like to thank the players for all their efforts that have allowed us to claim four trophies together. From this day, I wish them all the luck in the world and to the new coach Quique Setién also.

All the best to everyone.

The Blaugrana have since announced former Real Betis manager Quique Setién as Valverde’s replacement. He will be in charge until 2022. Barcelona return to La Liga action this weekend when they host Granada on Sunday.
