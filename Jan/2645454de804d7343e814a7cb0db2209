President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday returned to Nigeria from the United Kingdom (UK) as the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020 which held in London from January 17. Again, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was excluded from the team in the presidency that welcomed President Buhari at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on arrival in the country.
The President was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by the Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, FCT Minister, the Inspector General of Police, the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), and other government officials. The vice president was conspicuously missing in action, an issue revisiting the controversy about those running the presidency.
However, the vice president presided over the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday in the absence of the president.
