A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, Hon. Moshood Salvador, has ruled out the possibility of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) winning the state in 2023.
Salvador, a former state PDP Chairman, who made the statement in Lagos on Tuesday, said opposition party had no structure to defeat the APC in Lagos state.
He described the recent statement made by Mr Adedeji Doherty, the state PDP Chairman, that the party would dislodge the APC in 2023 as a pipe dream.
“You don’t expect him (Doherty) to tell you that PDP will lose, even if you belong to the FF or F9 party, you will say you will win the world.This is because you can’t have a political party without certain ambition, aspiration, determination and goal.
“The PDP chairman has to wish himself and the party well. It is his wish; PDP winning Lagos is wishful thinking. The success of any political party is its structure. Where is the structure in PDP now? None.
“Everyone has left the party, from the likes of Yomi Finnih, Obanikoro, Demola Seriki and myself, everybody has left. So, I am waiting to see where they will have the people to win,’’ he said.
Salvador said he left the PDP owing to irreconcilable differences with some elders of the party, whom he said, were not for its progress.
 
The APC chieftain added that he had no regrets dumping the PDP for the ruling party as he felt at home in APC.
He, however, noted that the administration of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu had fared well in the last nine months.
