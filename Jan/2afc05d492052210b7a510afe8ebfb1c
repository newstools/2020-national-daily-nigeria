Ahmad Sakilda on his twitter handle, @A_Salkida, decried that virtually everyone abandoned Leah, and therefore, shouldn’t have expected non-occurrence of the latest news.
The tweet read: “Why, I wonder, do we pretend that leaving Leah behind won’t result in pregnancy? Since the terror group announced condemning her to slavery, is there any step or collective focus on preventing similar occurrences? “She’s a mother, but I don’t know about the gender of the baby,”.
