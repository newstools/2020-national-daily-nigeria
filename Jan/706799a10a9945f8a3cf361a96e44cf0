Senator Shehu Sani, a former senator from Kaduna State may be swimming in deeper troubled waters in his encounter with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The Commission on Monday freeze the bank accounts of Shehu Sani denying him access to his bank deposits.
The Special Adviser to the embattled senator in a statement disclosed that the former lawmaker was “forced to declare his assets” in his encounter with the EFCC.
The Commission arrested Shehu Sani over allegation of demanding money from Sani Dauda, owner of ASD Motors, to bribe acting chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, to influence an investigation.
The senator denied the allegation, but the commission insisted that he has questions to answer.
The SA to Sani, Suleiman Ahmed, had protested the EFCC is biased and may be pursuing political goal in his principal’s case. The SA questioned why the commission did not detain Sani’s accuser “who admitted to giving bribe”.
He further questioned the connection between allegations of extortion of $25,000 and then the searching his residence, blocking his accounts and forcing him to declare his assets?
