The Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation has revealed how the Ukrainian air plane with 176 passengers on board crashed as its crew refused to call for help during the crisis.
The crew of another passing flight saw the plane engulfed in flames before crashing outside of Tehran, according Al Jazeera.
The Boeing 737-800, flying to Kyiv and carrying mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians, crashed shortly after taking off .
All of these happened after Iran attacked US bases in retaliation for the killing of its army Chief, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
“The plane, which was initially headed west to leave the airport zone, turned right following a problem and was headed back to the airport at the moment of the crash.
“The plane disappeared from radar screens the moment it reached 8,000 feet [2,400 metres]. The pilot sent no radio message about the unusual circumstances,” the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation said on its website
