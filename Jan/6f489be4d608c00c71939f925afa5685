Less than 48 hours President Muhammadu Buhari told the European Union and the United Nations that his administration has the capacity to defeat the Boko Haram terrorists in northeast Nigeria, amidst claims of technical defeat of the terrorists, the Boko Haram group launched a deadly attack at the weekend to falsify the claims of the president and demystify the warfare capacity of the government under his leadership.  Two female suicide bombers had attacked a Mosque in Gwoza, Borno State, killing a 12-year-old boy and injuring 13 others.
Ironically, the Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had on Channels Television programme at the weekend, remarked that Christians should be thankful to President Buhari because bombs have not exploding under his administration. The two female bombers, in their violent enterprise, may have ridiculed the presidential media adviser.
Reports indicated that the female bombers tried to force their way into the Mosque during the early morning prayers before some persons in the neighborhood raised alarm for interventions.
The report further indicated that residents suspected that the suicide bombers might have had access into the town during a wedding at the Palace of the Emir of Gwoza on Saturday.
The Borno State Police Command was said to have cordoned off the scene while soldiers from 192 Battalion have been deployed for vigilance.
