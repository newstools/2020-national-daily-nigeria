Another life-threatening hemorrhagic disease has broken out in Ogun State as Nigerians contend with Lassa fever in Edo, Ebonyi, and others.
Dengue fever is now in Ogun, according to the management of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, on Sunday alerted.
The disease has claimed one life, a 26-year-old woman.
She was originally reported to have died of Lassa Fever.
The Head of Clinical Services, FMC, Abeokuta, Dr Fedelis Ojeblenu, said this in a statement on Sunday.
Ojeblenu’s statement is at variance with the words of the Director of Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Mr. Segun Orisajo, who had earlier confirmed that one person died as a result of Lassa fever.
Orisajo had confirmed that a 26-year-old woman, Titilayo Akinsola, died of the disease on Saturday.
But the Head of Clinical Services faulted the report, saying, no one died of Lassa fever in the hospital.
A case of a pregnant woman who has been confirmed of having Lassa fever in the hospital was confirmed, though.
“Dengue fever is one of the haemorrhagic fevers with symptoms that are similar to those of Lassa, but is quite different in so many respects,” he said.
Dengue fever is a viral disease caused by mosquito.
Some symptoms of Dengue fever include high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and skin rash. It may lead to bleeding if not treated as early as possible.
