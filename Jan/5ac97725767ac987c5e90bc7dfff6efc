APC National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole has escaped removal plots by some of his executives as court declined an ex-parte application to oust him.
A Federal Capital Territory, FCT High Court, in Jabi, on Thursday declined the Ex-Parte Application filed by
The party’s National Vice Chairman, North East, Comrade Mustapha Salihu, a factional Chairman of the APC in Edo state, Anselm Ojezua and others, filed the motion before an FCT High Court in Jabi.
Counsel to Oshiomhole and APC, Damian D. Dodo (SAN), noted that they had not been served and drew the court’s attention to the Memorandum of Appearance and Undertaking to Accept Service of processes on behalf of the 1st & 2nd Defendants.
Responding, the Presiding Judge, Justice Danlami Senchi stopped the move and ordered that the Defendants be put on notice to ensure a fair hearing in the matter.
Justice Senchi ruled that it will hear all parties instead of granting the ex-parte application to remove Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of the APC as requested by the Plaintiffs.
The matter was adjourned to 18th February 2020 for hearing of the Claimants’ application.
Oshiomhole has been battling for survival as party chairman at the federal and state levels.
While some of his executives and state governors are heckling him because of his perceived high-handedness and scheming for 2023, the Edo state chapter ofthe APC and its Gov. Godwin Obaseki suspended him following the rift between him and his godson Obaseki.
