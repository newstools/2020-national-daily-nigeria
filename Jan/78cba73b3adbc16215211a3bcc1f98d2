A bed-ridden schoolteacher was raped by five secondary schoolgirls in Ogun Thursday.
The incident happened at ‎Ayetoro-Itele, a community in Ogun State.
The teacher eventually rescued after he was exhausted and left in a coma by the schoolgirls.
A neighbour called the local police, and he was taken to hospital for resuscitation. 
The girls reportedly filed into the teacher’s one room apartment, and after a while left the room, and the biology teacher was found naked by a neighbor who heard some noise, and decided to check on the sick man.
“I heard voices from inside his room, although faintly, because our rooms are far apart,’ an ElobahNews quoted the neighbour as saying.
“I thought he was merely having some conversation; I heard the moans too but who would think something like that would have happened.
“I found him naked few minutes after the girls left as I wanted to check on his health and so I called the attention of the nearest police.”
Police have vowed to investigate the matter, and dispense justice.
Females raping males is not a common crime in Nigeria, and the federal lawmakers are just working on a piece of legislation to criminalise it.
