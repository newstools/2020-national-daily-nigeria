The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, says the third term agenda being linked to President Muhammadu Buhari, is the handwork of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Oshiomhole who stated this when he addressed State House correspondents after the end of a closed door meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday, alleged that the PDP planted the idea of third term agenda in the sub-conscious of most Nigerians to further confuse the political space.
The APC chairman said: “I am surprised to see that there are people who begin to wonder why the President should reassure Nigerians that he is not going to do Third Term in office because Third Term was planted by PDP.
“It is still in the sub-consciousness of most Nigerians that the first (sic) Nigerian President tried to do Third Term, emptied the treasury to bribe members of the National Assembly and since that President left, thanks to the National Assembly, no other next President has done eight years in office.
“You can recall that President Yar’Adua unfortunately has since joined his ancestors, and President Jonathan did six years and so by the special grace of God, this President (Buhari) whom we pray will do his eight years complete in line with the provisions of the constitution.
“And because there is a level of idleness within a section of the political class people can sponsor all kinds of publications and to give doubt whether or not the President is planning to stay longer.
“And I think it is his decision that at every interval he needs to remind Nigerians that he is not about to do what a PDP President did. For me it is necessary and in any case it costs us nothing to reassure us that `I am leaving.’’
