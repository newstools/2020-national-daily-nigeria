One of President Muhammadu Buhari’s critics has revealed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, sought Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s favour when Buhari was on sick leave in the United Kingdom in 2017.
And the favour, according Junaid Mohmammed, in a chat with The Interview, was that Osinbajo should make Sanusi vice president when the law professor would step in as president. The emir, Mohammed said, was sure Buhari would not survive the sickness when he was away for months in London in 2017.
“Once Buhari was sick, very sick in England, he went to Osinbajo, this current Emir Sanusi; he was sure that Buhari was going to die. And if Buhari dies, he would like Osinbajo to consider him as a vice president, even though on the surface, he belonged to no party,’ he said in the interview.
“He wanted Osinbajo to consider him as vice president! Now, anybody with any sense of logic, any sanity would not countenance this kind of thing. If for whatever reason, this issue was reported to Buhari, if Buhari were another leader, he would have got rid of him in a jiffy.”
Mohammed said he was sure there are people involved who will now confirm what he just revealed.
He then blew another lid.
According to him, the Emir of Kano, when he was governor of Central Bank, went to see Bola Tinubu and went to see the current Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu telling them that a certain presidential candidate was actually the choice of Kano and the choice of the north.
“The Oba was diplomatic. But Tinubu told him in no uncertain terms that we are supporting Buhari; not because we like his face. We are supporting Buhari because, consistently, he has scored 12 million votes since he came into politics in 2002,’ he said.
“This is not the first time. I am now 70 years old. I am older than the Emir of Kano, who I have known since childhood. And I knew his father and mother.”
Mohammed has been a sour critic of Buhari’s since 2015.
