National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, says it’s not yet time to start discussing 2023 elections, noting that only unpatriotic people would be using future elections and politics to distract the President from facing governance.
Tinubu, who has been linked with nursing a presidential election in 2023 disclosed this when he spoke with newsmen on Tuesday shortly after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari behind closed doors in Abuja.
He also reacted to the alleged third term agenda being linked to President Buhari, saying sponsoring the rumours are detractors who were hell bent on destabilizing the country.
The former Lagos governor rubbished claims that Buhari is gunning for a third term, saying such assertion never existed.
He praised Buhari for dismissing the rumour in his New Year message to the nation.
According to him, only unpatriotic people would be using future elections and politics to distract the President from facing governance.
Tinubu added that he met with Buhari to consort with him and wish him well in the New Year.
