The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Thursday, said the Federal Government was right in detaining the convener of RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore and Sambo Dasuki, former National Security Adviser, NSA, despite court orders.
Malami said the Federal Government has the right to detain Sowore and Dasuki despite court orders for their release because there was a pending appeal at the Supreme Court.
Featuring on NTA, Malami insisted that the Federal Government never erred as the Supreme Court was yet to determine an appeal against the orders.
Malami said: “If a decision is made, or a judgement is passed, you have an option: one, absolute and unconditional compliance; two, challenge the order by way of either an appeal against it; or asking that the order be reviewed or appealing and applying for stay of execution.
“So, in respect of those orders we are not comfortable with as a government, we go back to the court and have them challenged. Until that matter, that your right of challenge, is determined up to the Supreme Court level, the idea of you being charged with disobedience of court order does not arise.
“There were appeals for stay of execution all through, so, until those matters reach the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court takes the final decision, relating there, you are still operating within the ambit and context of rule of law.”
The Department of State Services, DSS, had held Sowore and Dasuki in custody despite several court orders for their release.
However, a few weeks ago, Malami had ordered the DSS to hands-off the prosecution of Sowore. In a statement issued by his office, the AGF had ordered the release of Dasuki and Sowore.
