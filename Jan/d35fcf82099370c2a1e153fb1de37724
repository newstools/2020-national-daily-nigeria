A Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped INEC, Clerk of the National Assembly and Clerk of the Senate, from carrying out the judgment that sacked Anambra Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah from the Senate.
Same court sacked the YPP senator January 17.
Justice Bello Kawu, in a ruling, declined Ubah’s request to set aside the earlier order issued in a judgment delivered by the court on April 11, 2019.
Kawu sacked Ubah for allegedly submitting a forged National Examination Council (NECO) certificate, to contest the February 23, 2019 senatorial election.
But during commencement of trial on Thursday, Justice Taiwo Taiwo granted an interim order preventing parties in the matter from taking any step to execute the judgment of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory dated April 11, 2019, as well as ruling of the same court dated, January 17, 2020, pending the hearing and determination of a motion on notice Senator Ubah filed before it.
The court further fixed February 6 to hear Ubah’s suit marked.
