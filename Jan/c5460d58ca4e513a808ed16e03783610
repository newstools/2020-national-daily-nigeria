Isa Sulaiman, 23, will be wedding Janine Sanchez in Kano in two months’ time, Sanchez, a mother of two, is 46.
But the gap doesn’t matter to Sulaiman, a secondary school dropout who fell in love on Instagram with Sanchez, a chef living in California.
She flew in to Kano weeks ago to meet her darling.
According to Sulaiman in an interview with the BBC Pidgin Service, Nigerian women do not understand the basics of true love.
“Di truth be say our women no sabi wetin be true love, it is either dem dey eye somthin or dem get plans but if white woman tell you say she love you, bros she mean am from di bottom of her heart.”
“We meet after i start to follow her for instagram and if she post pishure i go like am, den afta small time I come see say some Yahoo boys dey try scam her, so I send her message say make she no mind those pipo so dat tin come attract her, e show her say na honest pesin I be. Na dat one first attract her.”
“From dia we come dey chat wella, video calls and na all dat one lead us to this level wey we dey.”
He said his family members are in support of his marriage, and he is now planning to wed her in March before moving with her to America.
“Afta di wedding for March by God’s grace na US straight for dia I go get work, go back to school na just secondary school i stop and hopefully get soccer team wey i go play for.”

“I don meet im family more dan 100 of dem and e sweet me say all of dem gree for us to marry, many of dem neva see white woman before, na so dem come dey play wit my hair, dey touch my hand.”
