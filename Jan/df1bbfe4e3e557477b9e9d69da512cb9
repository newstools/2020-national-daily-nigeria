The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has vowed to ensure the repatriation of former Minister of Petroleum, Diezani Alison-Madueke, from the United Kingdom, for prosecution on corruption charges in Nigeria.  EFCC Acting Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, had in a media interaction in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Wednesday insisted that that Diezani will be repatriated before the end of 2020 to face financial crime charges against her.
Magu after an inspection of the ongoing recruitment exercise for the commission in Ibadan, decried that Diezani has been enjoying protection outside Nigeria.
He lamented that the country where she resides currently has not established any offence she has committed.
“This year we must get her because they have no reason to keep her. They have not taken her to court, and we are in the fifth year, why should we be investigating a matter for five years?
“It’s a straight forward case, you know it’s a financial crimes investigation; it’s not a murder case, this is a straightforward case, if you don’t have any sufficient evidence to establish any offence, bring her back, we have more than enough evidence to take her to court.
“I don’t know why they are protecting her, release her let her come back to Nigeria; they are giving her protection for whatever reason and they are yet to disclose whatever offence she has committed, they are only relying on the evidence we have recovered,” Magu had said.
