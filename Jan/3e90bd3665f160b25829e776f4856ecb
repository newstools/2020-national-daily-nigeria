The Chief Missioner of Ansar – Ud – Deen Society of  Nigeria, Sheikh Ahmad Abdurrahman admonished the Member representing Mushin 2 Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives – Hon. Bolaji Yusuf Ayinla–by returning a Toyota Sienna car gift the lawmaker presented to him.

The globally renowned scholar preached humility and selflessness to the legislator and others  when reaching out to the less privileged in society.

He said any act of selfless giving will be adequately rewarded by Almighty Allah.

The preacher thanked the lawmaker for extending such gesture to him, but politely tasked Hon. Ayinla to take care of those in needs.

He used the occasion to pray for wisdom and good health for the political leaders in Nigeria.
