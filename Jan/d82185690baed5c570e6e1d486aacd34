Sporting Lisbon want Manchester United to include defender Marcos Rojo, in any deal that would take Bruno Fernandes to Old Trafford, according to O Jogo.

It is believed Sporting’s president Frederico Varandas and the Liga NOS club’s director, Hugo Viana, were in the UK last week negotiating the transfer.

Fernandes has reportedly agreed a five-year deal with the Premier League side.

The Red Devils are prepared to let Rojo leave, in order to complete the move.

The 29-year-old who joined United from Sporting Lisbon in 2014, almost left for Everton last summer and has started only one Premier League game this season.

Sporting would, however, look at other United players, if Rojo refuses to be part of the deal.
