The senatorial candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) in Imo North Senatorial District election, Ndubuisi Emenike, fell to the bullets of his own security guard, personnel of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on Sunday.
Reports indicate that the NSCDC operative was shooting consistently into the air when he accidentally  shot Emenike to death at  a victory party for the APC candidate, Miriam Onuoha, winner of the rerun election in Okigwe North Federal Constituency.
Emenike was said to have fallen into unconsciousness the moment the bullet hit him; he rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead.
Meanwhile, an official statement is still being expected from the NSCDC on the incident and the faith of the officer, yet to be identified, who was attached to the AA senatorial candidate, Ndubuisi Emenike, as his escort is yet unknown.
