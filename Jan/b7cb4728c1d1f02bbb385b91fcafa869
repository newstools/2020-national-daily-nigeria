MTN Nigeria is set to begin the process of withdrawing its case against the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice following the latter’s withdrawal for demand of N242 billion and $1.2 billion from the telecommunications company.
In a statement signed by MTN Nigeria’s Company Secretary, Uto Ukpanah, the company explained that while it would withdraw its legal process against AGF, it would engage the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) as directed by the office of the Attorney General.
Recall that MTN had filed a lawsuit against the office of the AGF following the demand, which the network provider said wasn’t in the Attorney General’s jurisdiction.
According to MTN, the alleged indebtedness would now be handled by the tax administrator and the customs service after the Attorney General consulted relevant statutory agencies. Both FIRS and Customs would now act to resolve the issue.
With the AGF handling the ‘contentious issues’ over to FIRS and Customs, MTN has disclosed that its case against the Attorney General’s office will now be dropped, with the network provider willing to work with the FIRS and Customs.
“MTN Nigeria will consequently follow due court process to withdraw its legal action against the AGF and engage with the FIRS and NC on the issues. MTN Nigeria remains committed to conducting its business in accordance with applicable laws in Nigeria,” it said.
Also, speaking on the withdrawal, Ferdi Moolman, the Chief Executive Officer of MTN Nigeria, said, “We are very pleased with the decision of the AGF and we commend him for his wisdom.
“We maintain our dedication to building and maintaining cordial relationships with all regulatory authorities in Nigeria and remain fully committed to meeting our fiscal responsibilities and contributing to the social and economic development of Nigeria.”
