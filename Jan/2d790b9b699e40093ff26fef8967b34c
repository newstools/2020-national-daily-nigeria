The federal government  is contemplating mass production of compressed natural gas (CNG) to ease the problem of energy, and makes petrol prices trend down..
Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva disclosed that the proposed CNG will cost between N95 to N97 per litre.
“CNG costs less than the subsidized PMS. Per liter the subsidized rate of the PMS is N145 per litre. CNG will cost about N95 to N97 per litre,” he told newsmen in Abuja Thursday.
According to him, the CNG fuel has undergone a pilot project in Benin City, and over 10,000 vehicles are already running on it.
He assured that Nigeria will never experience fuel scarcity again with CNG.
