The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, may have on Thursday succumbed to the fireworks of southwest leaders on the legality of Operation Amotekun, a security structure established by governors of southwest states.
The minister was shielded at a media interaction after the meeting of the southwest Governors with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, including Malami, when Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State stated that at no time had the federal government declared Amotekun illegal.
The Ondo Governor maintained that the Attorney-General “was misinterpreted”, clarifying: “It is so clear. At no time did the government want to stop Amotekun. So, there is no problem.”
Malami declined deep comment, saying: “the record has been set straight by His Excellency, I have nothing to add.”
However, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation had in a statement declared that, “The setting up of the paramilitary organization called ‘Amotekun’ is illegal and runs contrary to the provisions of the Nigerian law.” Reportedly declaring Amotekun unconstitutional, the AGF Office threatened that the full force of the law will be enforced on anyone promoting Amotekun.
