Summary of 388 Polling Units result

An advocacy group, Hope For Nigeria, has raised alarm that the Supreme Court judges relied on fabricated results from the controversial 388 polling units to dethrone Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples democratic Party (PDP) and declare Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor of Imo State.
The group chided the Chief Justice of the Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammed, and the six other Justices of the Supreme Court who the group said failed to properly scan through 20 page (388 line) documents containing the above results; and relied on the result to truncate the will of Imo People.
The group highlighted the controversial results which were identified to be inconsistent with authentic record of the INEC. The results run as followwes:
