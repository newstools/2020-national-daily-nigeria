Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode has tackled the National leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on his comment on Amotekun.
Recall that Tinubu had Wednesday in a statement said Amotekun presents a great opportunity for the country in its quest to enthrone true federalism, of which he has been an advocate since 1999.
He however called for a private discussion between the Governors of the South-west and the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami, to resolve misunderstanding over the security outfit.
But Fani-Kayode thinks Tinubu’s comment only ended up defending the Federal Government.
He described Tinubu’s long statement as ‘wishy washy’ and that he should stop defending the Federal Government.
He wrote on his twitter handle: “I read BAT’s wishy washy statement on Amotekun & his futile attempt to defend the FG. He should stop trying to defend the indefensible.
“If by now he does not know that the FG openly supports, encourages & protects those that kill our people then he is far dumber than I thought.”
