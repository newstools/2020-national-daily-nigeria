Senator Dino Melaye celebrates his birthday in grand style as he boldly alerted the world that he is ‘plus one today’. Melaye thanked god for marking the 2020 birthday in freedom, recalling that he marked his birthday in 2019 in Police detention.
Dino Melaye admitted the challenges of life but expresses optimism in human courage and divine interventions.
Dino Melaye expressing his joy on his twitter handle wrote: “I am plus one today; Oluwa ose.
“Lord, I just want to say thank you for this life you have blessed me with. It may not always be life that is trouble free or a life that is without challenges. In fact, I spent my New Year and birthday in 2019 in police detention, but I am thankful.”
Senator Melaye is a victim of the All Progressives Congress (APC) political onslaught to eliminate remarkable opposition politicians from the system.
