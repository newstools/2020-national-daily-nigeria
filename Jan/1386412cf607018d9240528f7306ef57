Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that he will not order the reopening of the country’s land borders till the final report of the committee set up on the matter was submitted and considered.
President Buhari disclosed this through his spokesperson, Femi Adesina, during his discussion with President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana at the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020.
He insisted that the borders were not only shut to prevent smuggling of food items but to also combat the smuggling of arms and ammunition, as well as hard drugs being ferried into the country.
“We will get things sorted out. Our farmers, especially those who grow rice, now have a market and are happy, and we are also concerned about hard drugs and weapons. Once the committee comes up with its recommendations, we will sit and consider them,” the President said.
Meanwhile, Buhari’s statement came after several complaints and comments by Nigerians, the business communities, West African states, especially Ghana and the international community on the good and bad sides of the policy.
The President insisted that he wasn’t going to sit and watch the country’s youth be destroyed through cheap hard drugs and an unchecked influx of small arms into the country.
Though the president stated that it was regrettable that the border closure was having a negative economic impact on the country’s neighbours, he, however, added that Nigeria cannot afford to endanger its people, particularly the youths.
“The Sahel region is awash with small arms, which accounts for severe security challenges in Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. We are in fact the biggest victims,” he added.
