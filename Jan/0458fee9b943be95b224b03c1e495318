Former military Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida, IBB, has stated hs own position on the southwest security initiative Operation Amotekun launched recently.
While many commended the initiative, the former military rulers thinks otherwise.
According to him on Channels Television’s Newsnight,  the governors’ may not be able to foot the needed expenses for Amotekun on the long run.
“They must equip them, you must pay them salaries. You must give them all the welfare they need. That is going to be a problem for the states. Where will they get the money to foot those bills?’ said Babangida.
“If they have succeeded in convincing the federal government to put out some part of the revenue for the purposes of that, I can understand that, but if they take it on themselves, it is going to be a problem.
He suggested the nation should have a closer look at the security outfits presently in operation– the army, the mobile police, the National Civil Defence Security Corps.
“I think they should be assigned specific responsibilities to lessen the financial burden this initiative would cost the government of the states in the long run.’
