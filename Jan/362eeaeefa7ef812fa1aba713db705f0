The federal government has vowed to keep mum as it watches the US implement its latest immigration policy which might be sweeping Nigeria along now.
Reports emerged on Tuesday, indicating that the President Donald Trump’s administration has plans to add seven countries across the world to their travel ban list.
Tanzania, Sudan, Eritrea, Nigeria, Kyrgyzstan, Belarusn and Myanmar were the countries mentioned.
In a statement on Wednesday, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said no  comment yet.
“Yes we have read the news that the Trump administration is planning to add a host of African, Asian and Eastern European countries to its travel restrictions list as reported by the US media.
“We are not going to react to speculations. We urge you to wait for us to see what unfolds under the new policy, its scope, its reach, the implications and its consequences before we react.”
Islamic countries initially got the ban when Trump came to office in 2016. But  most of those the new policy  affects are no Muslims.
