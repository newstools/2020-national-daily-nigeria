Nigeria’s Governor Simon Lalong of north central Plateau State has said he can now focus on governance without distraction as the Supreme Court verdict has cleared him of all litigation.
The Supreme Court ruling on Lalong’s re-election victory that was held today at the Nigeria’s capital city Abuja, was decided by a seven man panel presided by Justice Sylvester Ngwuta.
“The highest court in the land has stamped the mandate I was given and this means that our administration is now clear of litigation, distractions”.
Reacting to his victory on Monday, the Governor in a statement sent to our correspondent via his Director of Press, Dr. Makut Macham, also said the affirmation of his election victory by the Supreme Court has finally sealed and confirmed beyond further questioning the overwhelming mandate willingly bestowed on him by the people of his State.
“All along I was never in doubt as to the validity of my mandate as I did not only campaign and engaged all stakeholders, but I also delivered on my campaign promises during my first tenure which endeared the people to me.
“The time now is for governance and actualisation of our next level agenda encapsulated in our 3 point vision of peace, security and good governance; Infrastructural development and sustainable economic rebirth”.
Lalong called on the opposition to join hands with him in developing the State and pursuing projects and programs that will promote lasting legacies for the people.
“Intensify prayers for the peace and stability of the State which will enable rapid development to take place”, he said.
Our correspondent recalls that the Plateau opposition governorship candidate in the 2019 general elections, Jeremiah Useni, filed appeal challenging the outcome of the guber polls.
However haven gone through the election Tribunal and Appeal Court, the Supreme Court consequently struck out the case.
