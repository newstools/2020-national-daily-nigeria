One of the suspects arrested for killing and eating vital body parts of Favour Daley-Oladele, a final year student of Lagos State University, LASU, has claimed that she ate the witch’s brew containing the body parts in error.
The sspect, Mrs. Bola Adeeko spoke with reporters at Eleweran, the headquarters of the Ogun State Police Command where she was being paraded by the police alongside her son, Owolabi and Pastor Philip.
She said that the duo (Owolabi and Pastor Segun Philip), “deceived me into believing that the concoction was prepared with goat organs.”
The woman said she even vomited hours after eating the strange preparation by Pastor Philip while also denying knowing or participating in the killing of Favour.
According to her, she was “touched as a mother that someone’s daughter could be slaughtered and her organs used to prepare a delicacy.”
However, she said she actually went to Pastor Philip for “solution to my financial problems,” adding that she paid the pastor N200,000:00 to carry out the rites to redeem her from poverty
