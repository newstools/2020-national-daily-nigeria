Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Rev Father Ejike Mbaka, says his prediction that former Governor of Imo state, Emeka Ihedioha would be sacked by the Supreme Court was just one of the 40 prophecies he gave on December 31, 2019.
Recall that Ihedioha was sacked by the Apex court on Tuesday, asking the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to give the All Progressives Congress candidate, Hope Uzodinma a certificate of return as the duly elected governor.
Mbaka in a press statement issued by his spokesman, Maximus Ugwuoke, said Uzodinma becoming the governor of Imo was just a part of the about 40 prophetic prayers Fr. Mbaka made on December 31. But that became the only issue people satanically picked against him.
“God has vindicated Fr. Mbaka as He has always done for Fr. Mbaka and adoration ministry in all the battles, vituperations and attacks the ministry had faced in the past. To God be the glory.”
The statement claimed that the victory of Uzodinma was a testimony to the fact that Mbaka was truly an anointed man of God, adding that the unanimous agreement of the seven justices of the Supreme Court also showed that God was behind the prophecy.
“We are not all gifted alike, Fr. Mbaka’s prophetic gift should be a source of pride for the Catholic Church and indeed all true Christians as a living evidence of divine presence within the Church. As a lawyer, I tell you that there are double fold angles to this miracle.
“One is the miraculous resuscitation of Hope Uzodinma from the far away position he was placed in the election result announced by INEC in Imo State. The second is the unanimous confirmation of the seven Justices of the Supreme Court (without a dissent view) that Uzodinma was the rightful winner of the election”, the statement said further.
