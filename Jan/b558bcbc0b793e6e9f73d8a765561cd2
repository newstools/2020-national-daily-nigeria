A former Minister and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Femi Fani-Kayode, on Wednesday returned the fireworks of Garba Shehu, Senior Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhamamdu Buhari, who insulted Senator Enyinaya Abaribe of being foolish over his call on President Buhari to resign in his failure on national security.
Unguarded Garba Shehu had his Twitter handle written: “SENATOR ABARIBE’S CALL ON PRESIDENT BUHARI TO RESIGN IS FOOLISH
“President Buhari to resign on what basis? Just because some characters think that President Buhari should resign, then, they expect him to quit. That call does not represent the opinion of the country.”

Femi Fani-Kayode without hesitation took to the twitter where he wrote: “When the Presidency refers to the leader of the minority in the Senate as an “armchair critic” you know they are cursed. When will Shehu Garbage stop talking rubbish? If anyone should be in jail it is not Abaribibe but the calamitious affliction that he speaks for called Buhari.”
Fani-Kayode clearly debased Garba Shehu to rubbish talks over his indecorous attack on a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who denoted a symbol of authority of the Nigerian state complementary to the executive in the arms of government.
Several other Nigerians also poured out their disgust on the uncultured  and unpatriotic SSA in the country’s presidency.
