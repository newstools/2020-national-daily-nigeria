President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday may have endorsed Amotekun, the security structure established by governors of the southwest, Nigeria. The President represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN, at  meeting with South West Governors, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and the Inspector General of Police at the State House, Abuja, agreed on the way forward, while the federal government may have approved  aligning the Amotekun security structure with community policing in the southwest Nigeria.
A statement from the Presidency, Office of the Vice President, on Thursday indicated that the meeting was at the instance of the Governors who had asked to see President Muhammadu Buhari over the controversy surrounding the Amotekun Initiative.
It was noted that, however, due to the President’s foreign engagement, he asked the Vice President to host the meeting.
The statement by Laolu Akande, S.A on Media and Publicity to the Vice President, further indicated that unanimous resolutions were made on the way forward.
The statement read inter alia:  “Having regard to the need for all hands to be on deck in addressing the security concerns across the country, it was agreed that the structure of Amotekun should also align with the Community Policing strategy of the Federal Government.
“It was also agreed that necessary legal instruments will be put in place by each of the States to give legal backing to the initiative and address all issues concerning the regulation of the security structure.”
