Robbers suspected to be Fulani herdsmen attacked some motorists along the Ogbomoso-Ilorin expressway.
The attackers shot at the motorists including some Nollywood actors, at a checkpoint Monday morning at the Ote area of the expressway.
One of the Nollywood actors died in the shooting.
The dead victim, identified as Juwon, was a personal assistant to Yoruba actress Toyosi Adesanya. Both of them were on the journey.
“We can’t continue like this. The poor boy’s life was just taken away like that. We can’t continue to be held to ransom by some bandits. The FG should come to our aid,” she said.
The Kwara State Police Public Relations Officer Ajayi Okasanmi also confirmed the incident.
