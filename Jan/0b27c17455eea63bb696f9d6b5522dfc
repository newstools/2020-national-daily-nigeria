Inter Milan chief executive, Beppe Marotta, has confirmed the club’s interest in Chelsea winger, Victor Moses.
In recent times, the Italian giant has showed keen interest in bringing Moses to the club, where the former Super Eagles forward would get a second chance to work under manager, Antonio Conte.
Moses was loaned out to Fenerbahce by former Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri last January but has only played six times and scored one goal so far this season because of a recurring thigh injury.
The 29-year-old’s current contract with Chelsea expires in June 2021.
Asked about Inter Milan’s interest in Moses, Marotta was quoted by Sky Sport: as saying: “Moses? He is definitely a candidate.”
Apart from Moses, Inter Milan are also interested in signing Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud and Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen this month.
