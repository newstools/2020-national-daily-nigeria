She said on their way to the studio peruzi claimed to have gotten drunk and when they both entered the studio for the session instead of peruzi to honor his side of the deal, he surprisingly started touching her.

And afterwards, he immediately locked the door as he  started harassing her sexually. she said she tried to call 911 but 911 doesn’t works in Nigeria and she had to allow him to have his way.
