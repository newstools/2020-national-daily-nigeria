National Daily further gathered that Sporting Lisbon are however yet to agree on a transfer fee with the Red Devils, with United looking to pay around £17million less than the Portuguese club’s asking price.
Fernandes was strongly linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer before the Red Devils turned their attention to Harry Maguire.
United are back in for the midfielder, with Fernandes reportedly keen on making the switch.

The 25-year-old’s future is now in the hands of the two clubs, who must come to a compromise if Fernandes is to swap Portugal for the UK.
The Red Devils are reluctant to pay this much, and are instead looking to part company with £50million to make the transfer happen.
A number of Man United players had been suggested as makeweights in the deal.
Marcos Rojo, Joel Pereira and Andreas Pereira were all suggested, but Sporting would rather a bigger transfer fee for their prized asset.
Fernandes is set to play one last match for Sporting this Friday as his side take on bitter rivals Benfica in the league.
