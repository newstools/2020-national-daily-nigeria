Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has approved the N30,000 minimum wage in the state. The new wage takes effect from the January 2020.
Governor Obaseki signed into law the new minimum wage after a meeting with the organized labour at the Government House, Benin City.
The governor noted that agreement on the N30,000 new minimum wage was easily reached with the joint negotiating council based on transparency on both sides, with the government willing to provide a conducive atmosphere for workers to deliver their best.
The Governor acknowledged that the success recorded owes to the sincerity between government, labour and trade unions, noting “there should not be much difference between a state worker, federal government worker, and a local government worker because it is the same government.
“What we have done in Edo is to change the narrative by emphasizing on productivity. If you want someone to be productive, the minimum you can do is to pay the person a living wage,” Governor Obaseki said.
The governor disclosed that the next phase of welfare package for workers in the state will include capacity building of public servants to be more efficient and productive.
“Every worker must have health cover; every worker who is eligible must have a house mortgage of their own and every worker will undertake, at least one public service training in the public service training academy every year,” he stated.
Governor Obaseki had in his new year day broadcast assured that workers in Edo State will get the N30,000 minimum wage from January 2020; a promise he has fulfilled.
