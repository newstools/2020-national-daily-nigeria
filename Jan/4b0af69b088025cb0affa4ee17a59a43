Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, on Wednesday declared that there is no going back on Amotekun, insisting that the governors in the South West will pursue operation ‘Amotekun’ to a logical conclusion.
The Ondo State governor, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and former President of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) at the 2020 Armed Forces Remembrance Day in Akure, maintained that Southwest Governors are fully prepared to ensure operation ‘Amotekun’ succeeds.
Akeredolu noted that Amotekun is not a para-military outfit; he explained that the introduction of the security outfit is to complement the efforts of other security agencies in handling security crisis in the southwest.
The governor, however, remarked that the nation is grateful for the selfless service of the Armed Forces through their contributions and sacrifice in defending and protecting the territorial integrity of Nigeria.
