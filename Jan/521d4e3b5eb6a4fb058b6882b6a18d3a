The Emir of Kano, His Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has cautioned over the rising tension between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria.  The Emir of Kano at the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace was of the view that ignorance is precipitating the tension between Christians and Muslims in the country.
Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, representing the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III , at the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace, in his opening speech, advocated the need for political leaders Nigeria to protect the interest of the poor and less privileged in the society. He decried the high rate of crime and the deepening poverty in the country, making a case for good governance.
The Emir added that traditional and religious leaders are supposed to hold political leaders in the country to account for their actions but lamented: “we are being cowed into silence.”
