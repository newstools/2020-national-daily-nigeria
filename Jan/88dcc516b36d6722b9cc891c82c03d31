Reports reaching National Daily from Italian radio have it that Manchester United are on the brink of a sensational transfer of Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly.
Man United have always targeted Koulibaly to strengthen their defence
The Italian journalist Fabio Santini revealed that the signing, worth around £60m, for the Senegalese player is ‘all done’. The Red Devils have had the Senegalese 28-year-old on their radar for a number of transfer windows.
National Daily further gathered from the suggestion from the latest reports from Santini that Kalidou will be a United player come the summer.
Santini told TV show Il Processo on the station 7 Gold: ”Napoli will sell Kalidou Koulibaly to Manchester United for a figure of around 70-75m Euros. It seems all done”.
Koulibaly could be United player by summer
He went on to add: ”Naturally, such a deal will be closed only in June and certainly not in January in the winter transfer window”.
United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad have suffered tremendously when it comes to their defence so adding Koulibaly will no doubt bolster their back line.
Harry Maguire joined the squad at the start of the season on a deal worth £80m, but the centre-back not been able to overturn the weakness at the back.
Although United were back to their best over the weekend with a 4-0 thumping victory over Norwich, Maguire believes inconsistency has been the team’s biggest issue.
He told reporters after the win: ”Our problem has been inconsistency.
”We have played two good games and one bad game and it has not been good enough in terms of that. We are not getting carried away. It was a good performance, clean sheet,win but we have to go again on Wednesday and get another good result.
”Like I said, if we put a few wins together on the bounce we will have every chance of a top four finish”.
Maguire recently returned from injury but has said he is ready to go again.
