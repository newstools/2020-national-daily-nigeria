The rift between Ogun APC Gov. Dapo Abiodun and his godfather Olusegun Osoba is widening, and neither side cares if the public knows.
That was why Osoba and members of his group, the Osoba Political Family, refused to show up the swearing-in of the state commissioners and advisers on the weekend.
The Osoba Political Family began whining when Abioudun was picking his cabinet members. They protested the composition of the cabinet doesn’t favour the group which believe sit worked the hardest for the victory of Abiodun at the guber poll.
Godfathers and their godsons have been falling apart in Nigerian politics lately.
Similar disagreement—or disloyalty, as some say—has soured such relationship in Edo—between Gov. Godwin Obaseki and PC chairman Adams Oshiomhole; Bayelsa—between former President Goodluck Jonathn ad Gov. Seriake Dickson; Lagos—between former Gov. Akinwumi Ambode and APC national leader BolaTinubu.
In the latest in Ogun, in addition to Osoba and his group, others who shunned the ceremony held at the Cultural Centre, Kuto, Abeokuta on Friday were Ogun-East Sen. Tolu Odebiyi,  Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Prof Sidi Osho, and the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation spokesman Remmy Hassan.
Others were:  Segun Adesegun, the director-general of thecampaign organisation; former deputy governor, Gbenga Kaka; and a former senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial district, Gbenga Obadara.
But the governor said not to worry—that more appointments ahead will go round the party faithful.
