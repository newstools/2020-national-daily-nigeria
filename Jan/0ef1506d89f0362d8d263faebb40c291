Barcelona have gotten a bit of good news over their top January transfer target Dani Olmo. The Dinamo Zagreb forward admitted that he’s pleased with a return to former club.

The Spain under-21 international spent time in the Barcelona academy as a youngster before moving to Dinamo Zagreb at a very young age 16. He has since become a very important player for the Croatian side especially in the UEFA Champions League this season.

“It makes me happy that Barcelona are considering bringing me home,” he told L’Esportiu.

“I spent six years at La Masia and they taught me life lessons.”

He was part of the squad that won the European Under-21 Championship in 2019 alongside Fabian Ruiz who is also another target for Barcelona and he is hoping to make the senior squad for this summer Euros.

“My objective is to go to the Euros. This will be difficult for me because I’ll be playing in a lesser league, the Croatian one, for the next six months,”he said.

“I want to take a step forward and, not only go to the Euros, but keep improving. It’s not that [Zagreb] aren’t offering me this, it’s that I think I’m ready to take a step forward in my career.”
