Lalong also laud President Buhari for his support in ensuring that all those in captivity are set free, and calling on security agencies not to rest until all terror group and other criminals are fished out and dealt with.

Similarly, the federal lawmaker said his joy and that of Jennifer’s family knows no bounds, praising the courage and bravery of security operatives, for the sacrifice to protect the country from the hands of evil men.


“I wish to salute the rare steadfastness of her family especially her widowed mother, Mrs. Naomi Samuel who showed more courage and faith than any of us, praying ceaselessly for her release”, Maren said.

The lawmaker, however plead with the Army to also facilitate the release of other Nigerians who are still being held hostage by Boko Haram.
