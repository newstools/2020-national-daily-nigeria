The popular female musicians Yemi Alade reveals in one of her shows last week that many had been disturbing her to marry.

She said most especially her parents. But she keeps telling them to remain calm that is not yet time.

When she was asked why is she never married?

She said she’s passing through a lot that’s not clear to people.

She said not that she’s not into any relationship but she does tell her husband to be to always give her time.

She said she’s pursuing her career first.

When she was asked who the lucky guy is, she said it’s someone that everyone knows.

Then the reporter said many had been saying it’s Falz.

She laughed and said her relationship is confidential to her.

I think I would put it into consideration this year.

I’m your one and only Yemi Alade.
