“As such, the Digital Identity Number is completely free for all Nigerians and legal residents with Resident Permit from the Nigeria Immigration Service.
“The Digital Identity Number is the right of every citizen, based on the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Act 2007,” he explained.
