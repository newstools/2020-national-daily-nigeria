Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on Monday accused global powers of frustrating Nigeria’s fight against terrorism by deliberately blocking Nigeria’s moves to acquire needed armament to end terrorism and insurgency,
Speaking with newsmen on the side-line of a visit he paid to Benue State’s Gov. Samuel Ortom, the minister said the action of the world powers was deleterious and frustrating Nigeria’s resolve to end the twin-menace as well as end extremism.
He said notwithstanding the frustrations, the Federal Government would fight terrorism and insurgency to a logical conclusion.
“We will never stop protecting lives and livelihoods. However, we must also understand that we are dealing with terrorists who are financed globally and we also need more support from global partners. For instance, Nigeria had made attempts to acquire better and more effective platforms to deal with the terrorists, but for one reason or the other we have been denied these platforms, he said.
The minister also condemned the “mindless killing of innocent Nigerian farmers by extremists in Borno last week’’.
“What actually happened in Borno was quite unfortunate, but we also have to look at the strategy of the terrorists. Terrorists use media and publicity as oxygen and so when they go on this kind of mindless killing, a dying terrorist group will suddenly spring to life.
The minister also said the Federal Government had done so much in addressing security challenges facing Benue State.
