Morgan’s Public Relations manager, Muyiwa Babalola, had claimed she reached out to Davido through phone calls and WhatsApp messages but all to no avail.

Babalola had said, “She (Morgan) wanted to meet with David so they could both deliberate on the type of music that would be perfect for both parties; she was game for whatever they both eventually decided was best. She was hoping they would meet, talk and allow a synergy that could birth an organic content.

“But then again, after several attempts to reach Davido directly, she thought it was better she just did a demo verse first, which she did and sent it across to Davido camp.  It’s over three months now, we are yet to hear anything from Davido directly or any of his representatives.”

But, Davido’s manager, Asa Asika, stated that the claim by Morgan was not true.

“She knows that is not the truth. All these people are looking for clout; she is looking for who she would use to shine again.

“I know David sent her a song that she recorded. So, how did David send her the song if they did not communicate? It is one of the songs that we didn’t use for the album. She recorded her verse and sent it back to us. The song was recorded some months ago.”

Asika further revealed why the song was dropped by Davido, saying, “I actually do not like her verse. That is actually one of the reasons why we have not used the song. I personally do not like the song and I told David that I did not like it.”
