Armed bandits on Christmas day, Friday, kidnapped the Kaduna State Chairman of the Pentecost Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Apostle Emmanuel Bako, his wife and one other person in the state.
The security operatives in Kaduna State were said to have admitted that Bako was kidnapped with his wife, Cindy, and one other person on Friday, Christmas Day, in Jema’a Local Government Area, Kaduna State.
It was gathered that the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement on Saturday, acknowledged that unidentified gunmen invaded the Albarka Praying Camp, along the Afana-Fadan Kagoma-Kwoi Road, then, opened fire, shooting sporadically. The security operatives were said to have disclosed that the bandits shot at a vehicle while whisking away the PFN chairman, his wife, and another victim from the prayer camp to an unknown destination.
Commissioner Aruwan had in the statement indicated that security operatives arrived the prayer camp timely on urgent intervention and chased the kidnappers who fled with their captives.
The Kaduna PFN Chairman’s kidnap added to the raging war against Christians by the Nigerian government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Several Christians, including Pastors, have been kidnapped and murdered in cold blood by the Boko Haram terrorists in the north east. The bandits appear to be doing finishing jobs in the north west on the war against Christians in Nigeria under the current government in the country.
Meanwhile, believers have gone into prayers for the safety and freedom of the Kaduna PFN Chairman, his wife, Cindy and the other victim kidnapped by the bandits. At the same time, it was gathered that the demand for ransom is being awaited from the bandits.
