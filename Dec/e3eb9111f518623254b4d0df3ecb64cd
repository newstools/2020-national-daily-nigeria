Shehu Garba made the apology after 340 students of the school kidnapped by bandits last Friday night were declared by the Katsina State government o have been released. Governor Aminu Masari subsequently presented the students to President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday.
Over 840 students were said to be present in the school when the bandits struck. Security operatives on intervention accounted that 200 students returned same Friday after the incident which made people scamper for safety. Invariably, about 600 students were feared missing or kidnapped by the bandits but Governor Aminu Masari declared that 333 students were kidnapped while Shehu Garba said that only 10 students were kidnapped. Boko Haram had claimed that over 560 students were kidnapped but on Thursday 340 students were declared to have regained freedom.
Shehu Garba un a tweet on Friday declared: “I apologize for the incorrect communication citing that only 10 students were kidnapped at the science school, Kankara.
