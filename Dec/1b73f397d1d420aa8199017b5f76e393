US President-elect Joe Biden received his first injected dose of the Covid-19 vaccine live on television on Monday December 21, in an effort to reassure its safety ahead of its wide distribution next year.

Biden received the vaccine alongside his wife, Jill at ChristianaCare Hospital in Newark, Delaware. They will each need another round of vaccinations developed by Pfizer-BioNTech in about 21 days.

“I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine,” Biden said after rolling up the left sleeve of his polo shirt and receiving the shot. “There’s nothing to worry about. I’m looking forward to the second shot. So is Jill.”

He also said the Trump administration “deserves some credit” for launching the country’s vaccine programme.

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff are expected to receive their vaccination next week, the transition announced.

The Biden team has set a goal of 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in the US during the administration’s first 100 days in the White House.
