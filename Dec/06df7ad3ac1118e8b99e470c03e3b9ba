Everton star, Alex Iwobi has disclosed that Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, helped him to become a key player today.

The Nigerian international said that Arteta, who he played alongside at Arsenal after coming through the Gunners’ academy system, made life easier for him when he was pushing through.

Iwobi said this ahead of Everton’s Premier League clash with Arsenal on Saturday evening.

“I wouldn’t be where I am today, so I am forever grateful for the opportunity they [Arsenal] gave me,” Iwobi told Sky Sports.


“I can look at everyone, Arsene Wenger, Unai Emery. Even current manager Mikel Arteta, when I was playing under-21s at the time, he was coming back from an injury and would be playing for us.

“There’s been a lot of people that have been able to help me.

“When I was breaking through, Arteta was still there, and he was always helping – not just me, but any youngster – he made life easier when I was pushing through.”


Iwobi, 24, left Arsenal in 2019 for Everton.
