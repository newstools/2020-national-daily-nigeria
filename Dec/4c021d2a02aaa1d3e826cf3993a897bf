Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State on Sunday condoled the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, over the death of police officers who drowned while conveying voting materials for the Saturday, December 5 senatorial bye-election.
The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Daniel Alabrah, in a statement recalled that the boat conveying the police personnel and election materials capsized on its way to Oporoma, headquarters of Southern Ijaw Local Government Area.
The governor in the statement by the CPS on Sunday further extended his condolence to the families of the deceased police officers, decrying that the sudden demise of the security operatives while on national duty was very painful.
The governor noting that the incident is unfortunate, prayed that God gives the IGP and the families of the policemen the strength to bear the great loss.
The Governor subsequently commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for conducting peaceful by-election in the state.
After casting his vote at Ward 7 Unit 4 in his town, Sampou, accompanied by his wife, Gloria Diri, the governor stated that INEC’s decision of having accreditation and voting simultaneously saved time and energy.
“The process was faster and even smoother. The card reader identified me as soon as my voter’s card was slotted in.
“So, I can describe the process as smooth, fast and peaceful. Certainly, the simultaneous accreditation and voting enhanced the process rather than waiting for hours before coming back to vote. I think this decision of taking them at the same time is far better than what we used to do,” Governor Diri said.
