The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has deepened rebuilding of the party towards the 2023 general elections. Accordingly, APC National Executive Committee (NEC) at the meeting on Tuesday in Abuja dissolved the Executive Councils of the party structures in the various wards, states, local and zones across the country. This decision is in addition to the membership registration of existing and new stakeholders across the country.
Consolidating on the reorganization of the party, the APC NEC at the Tuesday meeting elongated the tenure of the caretaker committee by six months. Tenure elongation had generated controversies in the ruling before the meeting. There were strong oppositions to the extension of the caretaker committee.
A major fallout at the NEC meeting was the expulsion of the party’s vice-chairman, south-south, Ntufam Hilliard Eta, for refusal to withdraw a suit against the caretaker committee.
Also, the NEC granted waivers to new APC members who recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other parties to qualify them to contest for elections without waiting for two years as was previously the condition.
President Muhammadu Buhari had directed NEC members to adopt all the proposals of the caretaker committee and grant all the necessary approvals necessary to rebuild the party.
