The absence of Magistrate A. A. Ajibade of an Osogbo Magistrate Court in Osun state has stalled the trial of a civil servant, Gbenga Samson Ayenioye and his friend, a Nollywood Actor, Tunde Amoke Oja, over alleged rape of a teenager.

The case which was to be held on December 30th in Osogbo was stalled due to the absence of the Chief Magistrate who according to a source was on leave.

This will make it the second time the case will be adjourned without commencement of hearing.

Newsmen reported that the Osun Police Command arrested the teacher, Samson who was just promoted to the state ministry of Education and his friend, AmokeOja, for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl who is said to be one of his students.

The Police, after the victim’s complaints, through a Non-Governmental Organisation in the state, Value Female Network (VFN), had dragged the duo to court on October 7 in Osogbo.

Magistrate Taofeek Badmus who was first presiding over the case ordered the remand of the alleged offenders.

Few days after the remand of the accused persons in Ilesa Prison custody, Magistrate Badmus was transferred to another town in the state and was replaced with Magistrate Ajibade.

After spending some days in prison custody, the accused persons were granted bail by Magistrate Ajibade, the case was thereafter adjourned till December 30, 2020, for hearing.

Upon Ajibade’s absence, the court has, however, fixed February 10, 2021, for hearing.

The prosecuting counsel from the State Ministry of Justice, Bankole Awoyemi and the defence counsel, Abimbola Ige agreed on the new adjourned date.
