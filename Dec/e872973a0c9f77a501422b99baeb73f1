The Ogbobula Isaac-led Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State has suspended Senator Magnus Abe, Igo Aguma, Livinstone Wechie and Worgu Boms.
Isaac, who made the declaration on Saturday in Port Harcourt, recommended their expulsion from the party accusing them of anti-party activities.
He also declared the expulsion of all the persons, who were inaugurated as caretaker committee leaders in wards and local government areas by Aguma.
Recall that different factions loyal to both the Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe have continued the battle to take control of the structure of the party ahead of the next general election.
While a faction of the party in Rivers State led by Abott Ogbobula, a loyalist of Amaechi, had inaugurated a Caretaker Committee for the party last week, Igo Aguma leader of the faction of the party loyal to Senator Magnus Abe also inaugurated a parallel Caretaker Committees in Port Harcourt at the weekend.
However, it is worthy to note that Ogbobula was only one recognized by the National Executive Council of the party inaugurated at the party’s Secretariat in Abuja.
