The PPRO, Adejobi highlighted: “the suspects, on sighting the RRS operatives, took to their heels but were given a hot chase by the police before they were eventually arrested.
“During preliminary interrogation, the suspects confessed to have been terrorising and responsible for some traffic robberies and other crimes at Isheri, Ojodu, Berger, Motorways, Agidingbi, Ketu, Alapere, and Ogudu.”
