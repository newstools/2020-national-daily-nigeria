There is big relief at the Lagos State government house, Alausa, as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was declared to be responding well to coronavirus treatment by the medical team.
The Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, on Sunday via his Twitter handle disclosed Governor Sanwo-Olu was responding well to home-based care and COVID-19 treatment since he tested positive and went into isolation.
Professor Abayomi stated that Governor Sanwo-Olu is in high spirit and very appreciative of the prayers and well wishes he has received from the people of the state and the country in general.
The commissioner in an earlier tweet promised to keep the public regularly notice of the governor’s recovery and wellbeing.
Earlier Governor Sanwo-Olu had gone into isolation after an aide tested positive to coronavirus. On being tested, the governor was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 and experiencing symptoms and fatigue.
Governor Sanwo-Olu is being treated and monitored at home by a clinical team from the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba.
