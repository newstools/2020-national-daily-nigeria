The fracas in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State has continued to escalate. This degenerated into the suspension of the State Chairman, Adedeji Doherty, from the party.  Party stakeholders indicated that the suspension was the result of ‘a vote of no confidence’ on Doherty, who is being accused of anti-party activities, mismanagement, etc.
The State PDP Executive, led by the State Secretary, Muiz Shodipe, at a press conference in Lagos, expressed accused the dethroned state chairman of financial mismanagement and polarisation of the party.
Shodipe protested that Doherty, in disregard to the party’s, was often making pronouncements that were never discussed at any party forum.
The State Secretary decried that elders of the party in Lagos State had made Doherty leader of the party as unifying factor, but he had been acting to the contrary.
Shodipe lamented that the dethroned state chairman has been ordering members loyalty to himself or declaring members as “persona non grata” if they are unwilling.
The State Secretary declared: “The chairman lacks transparency in management and accountability of the party finances and administration.
“Since assumption of office as the state chairman in the past one year, Doherty has failed to, at least, convene just one state assembly meeting.
“The assembly meeting comprised of all strata of the party at all levels, most importantly the state working committee and the state executive members.’’
