Eight guards, including police officers, in the convoy of the emir of Kaura Namoda were killed Friday morning along the Zamfara –Abuja road
Gunmen ambushed Emir Sanusi Muhammad-Asha and his entourage as they returned from Abuja around 3 am o Friday.
According to Abdulkarim Ahmad-Asha, an uncle of the emir, the gunmen fired shots at a Hilux vehicle at the front of the convoy, killing the driver, three policemen and four others.
“But Almighty Allah in his infinite mercy had made the Emir and his wife to escape the attack unscathed,” the uncle told the Daily Trust.
The Emir, a retired major, reportedly spent the night in safe custody in Funtua local government area of Katsina.
There is no official statement by the police confirming the incident.
Zamfara has been in the news since a gang of bandits herded 344 school children from their hall at Kankara , straight into the forest, and on to Zamfara last Friday.
The northwestern state has been home to bandits mostly operating as kidnappers and rustlers.
