The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State is chasing former Governor of Kano State, Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, into political wilderness. The State PDP in Kano led by Aminu Wali, on Thursday expelled Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso from the party, alleging anti-party activities.
PDP emergent Chairman, Muhammina Lamido, at a press conference on Thursday after a state congress meeting in Kano, announced the sack of Kwankwaso from the party with immediate effect. This action seriously threatens Kwankwaso’s presidential ambition in the 2023 general elections.
The PDP leadership controlled by the Wali faction accused Kwankwaso of engaging in gross violation of the PDP constitution.
The Chairman of the Kwankwaso faction of the PDP in Kano, Shehu Sagagi, swiftly dismissed the congress as a charade conducted in contempt of a subsisting court order.
Sagagi was said to have declared that the Kwankwaso faction is the PDP structure recognized by the party Secretariat in Abuja, as well as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
The factional state chairman vowed to sanction any erring PDP member in Kano State.
