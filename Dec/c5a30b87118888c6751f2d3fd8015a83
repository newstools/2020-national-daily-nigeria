Barely 24 hours after Lagos state ordered schools to close indefinitely and civil servants to work from home, as the second wave of COVID-19 sweeps across Nigeria, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has insisted that the state cannot afford another lockdown.
Sanwo-Olu, who himself is recovering from the virus, had also issued a strong warning to religious organizations and banned gatherings.
In a statement on Friday, he thanked residents in the state for the show of love and concern over his health, noting that the gesture touched him deeply and reaffirmed the connection to one another as humans.
“I acknowledge and thank you very sincerely and pray that none of us will lose our lives to COVID-19, and in any other preventable circumstance.
“To families that have lost loved ones to the virus, I pray that God grants you the fortitude to bear the loss.
“Yesterday, we issued guidelines to help us in the next phase of our battle with the virus. Lagosians have relaxed and the effects are evident with increasing cases and unfortunate deaths.
“We cannot afford another total lockdown so I enjoin us to keep observing the prescribed protocols and the required lifestyle adjustments that will help us enter 2021 stronger, healthier and safer.
“Let’s do this for our families and friends. Let’s by our actions demonstrate that we truly love our neighbours.
“Let us demonstrate awareness about the existence of COVID-19 in our communities and live right to deliberately reduce and eliminate its spread.
“I wish you the best of this season and pray that God Almighty will continue to protect us,” the statement read.
