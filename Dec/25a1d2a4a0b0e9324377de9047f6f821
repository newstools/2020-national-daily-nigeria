Katsina Gov Aminu Masari visited President Muhammadu Buhari on Mondy at Daura, Ktsina, to brief the commander-in-cief of Nigeria’s armed forces on the Kankara schoolboys abduction and rescue Friday night.
According to the APC governor, the abductors of the hundreds of students from the secondary school have contacted the state government.
In a statement signed by Garba Shehu on Monday, the presidency quoted the governor as saying progress is being made in the rescue of the students.
“We are making progress and the outlook is positive,’’ the governor reportedly told reporters after an hour meeting with the president, which started at 2 p.m.
He added that discussions were already on pertaining to the student’s safety and return to their homes.
Masari also noted that security agencies had located the position of the children.
“President was fully committed to the rescue of the school children,” adding that “it was only appropriate to visit the President and give him more details of rescue efforts,” he said.
Boko Haram is known to use the mass kidnap tactic, and has succeeded in kidnapping more than 250 Chibok schoolgirls in Borno in 2014, and more Dapchi girls in 2016.
But the Katsina incident, which reportedly killed two students and a police officer, was carried out by bandits—for ransoms.
It is very likely the on-going negotiation between the government and the kidnappers will ensure the safe release of the schoolboys, and there will be no room for military action.
But the defence headquarters insists the negotiation won’t prevent the military from taking action.
