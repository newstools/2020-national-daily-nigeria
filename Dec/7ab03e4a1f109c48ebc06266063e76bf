Fugitive Abdulrasheed Maina, chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Force facing prosecution for embezzling N2billion, has been caught in Niger.
The Nigerian Intelligence Agency and the Niger Republic Intelligence Service arrested the bail hopper on Monday.
Maina was running away for te second timeâ€”and he got his surety Sen. Ali Ndume into problem this time.
Abuja High Court Justice Okon Abang had to send Ndume up for failing to produce Maina when trial resumed in September.
Nddume, however, was granted bail last Friday.
Maina is expected to be bundled into Nigeria Tuesday or Wednesday.
