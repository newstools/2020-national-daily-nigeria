The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Sunday scolded President Muhammadu  Buhari over the unwarranted tear gas attack by the Nigeria Police on the sorrowing parents of the kidnapped students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State.

 


The PDP described as disturbing that such callousness could be meted on the grief-stricken parents after President Muhammadu Buhari, who had gone holidaying in the state, failed to protect their children from terrorists.
The PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, declared: “it is indeed sad that instead of going after terrorists and insurgents, that struck few hours after a holidaying President Buhari and his security machinery took over the state, the state apparatus of power is being used to inflict further pain on the helpless victims.
“Such display of insensitivity further foregrounds the lack of empathy by the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) government and serves as a sad reminder of how it also blamed the 43 farmers recently slain by terrorists in Borno State, instead of taking steps to apprehend the assailants.
“Indeed, our party shares the pains and sorrows of these parents who have been under serious torment since President Buhari arrived Katsina for his needless holidays.”
The PDP, therefore, called on the Buhari Presidency to immediately apologize to Nigerians and the parents of the kidnapped students as well as take steps to ensure disciplinary actions on those who ordered the tear gas attack on the parents.
The PDP restated its call to President Buhari to go in search of and rescue the students, who were kidnapped while his security machinery was in charge of the state.
The PDP reiterated its stand, in solidarity with the people of Katsina State and other patriotic Nigerians, not to rest until President Buhari finds and rescues each of these young ones.
