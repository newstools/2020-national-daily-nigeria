Ekiti State government on Monday cautioned residents against engaging in business transactions with unverified loan givers to avoid being scammed.
The warning is contained in a statement issued by the State’s Commissioner for Information and Values Orientation, Mr. Akin Omole on Monday.
He said some unscrupulous persons and organisations were going about baiting people with attractive loan packages to swindle the gullible, citing a particular viral video of some women in the state that were allegedly swindled by one of such companies as unfortunate and sad.
He expressed the government’s sympathy with the fraud victims, stressing that the issue was particularly lamentable because the government already established a Microfinance and Enterprise Development Agency where traders and artisans could obtain soft loans.
According to him, relevant security agencies are already on the trail of the swindlers.
The commissioner also advised Ekiti State people to make proper inquiries at the Ministry of Trade and Industries for available loan facilities for small and medium scale businesses to avoid falling prey to fraudsters.
