After nine months of industrial action and collective bargaining heightened by corovirus lockdown in Nigeria, the Academic Staff Union of Universities in Nigeria has finally reached an agreement with the federal government.
The union has therefore called off its strike, and varsities across the nation will reopen—on condition though.
ASUU National President, Biodun Ogunyemi, made the announcement during a briefing of the union in Abuja on Wednesday.
He said the suspension of the strike takes effect from Thursday, December 24th, 2020.
Ogunyemi said the union sympathised with students who were also their children.
“No amount of sacrifice would be too much to get the matter resolved as long as the government is consistent with its commitments.”
Labour Minister Chris Ngige, on Tuesday, had earlier informed Nigerians the strike would be called off before January 15.
But Ogunyemi warned that the union would return to strike without notice if the government fails in meeting its part of the agreement reached with the university lecturers.
The resumption, he said, however, lies with the Federal Government and Senate, considering the covid-19 restrictions in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic.
