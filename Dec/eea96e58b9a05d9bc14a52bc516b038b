The crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State has deepened, leading to the suspension of five party members. The suspended members were accused of anti-party activities.
The PDP State Publicity Secretary in Ondo, Kennedy Peretei, in a statement on Tuesday, indicated that the suspended members include Oyedele Ibini, Lad Ojomo, Ayo Fadaka, Rasheed Elegbeleye, and Ebenezer Alabi.
The State Publicity Secretary had declared: “Pursuant to Section 58(1)(a)(b)(f) and (h) of the Peoples Democratic Party Constitution (2017 as Amended), the party members are hereby suspended indefinitely from the party for anti-party activities and gross misconduct.
“By this decision, they are expected to stop parading themselves as members of the party. All organs of the party are to take note in this regard.”
Peretei maintained that the five politicians stand suspended from the party until the outcome of the report of the State Disciplinary Committee.
The Publicity Secretary also disclosed the dissolution of the State Elders’ Committee of the party in Ondo State by the PDP leadership.
The Ondo State Publicity Secretary noted that the dissolution of the Elders Committee is in accordance with the provisions of the PDP Constitution (2017 as Amended). He assured that another State Elders’ Committee would soon be constituted.
Peretei said that the PDP State Executive Committee did not send any delegation to anywhere to represent the party.
He cautioned that whoever claims to be the party’s delegate is an impostor and does not represent the PDP in Ondo.
