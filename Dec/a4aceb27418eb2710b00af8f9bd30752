As AP national leder Bola Tinubu footmen have slid into action mode in prepration for the 2023 presidency, loylists to Ekiti Gov Kayode Fayemi have also put forward their man for the APC ticket.
“The time has come for President to come from Ekiti. That is why we are pleading with you to support Governor Fayemi,’ the caretaker chairman of the APC Ekiti Chapter, Paul Omotoso, said the Saturday.
The ruling party said its members will drag the governor into the presidential race, if he refuses to willingly contest, saying Fayemi is eminently qualified to occupy the exalted position considering his intimidating political profile.
Omotoso said Fayemi has paid his dues in the ruling APC and Nigeria’s political firmament at large, and he deserves to be entrusted with the responsibility of leading Nigeria in 2023.
“Though Governor Fayemi has never said he wanted to contest, we will force him to plunge into the race, because of his competence, dedication, and loyalty to APC”, he said.
A zealot from the state chapter early in the year made posters declaring Fayemi’s candidacy. The partyman was however disciplined, and the governor dissociated himself from such declaration.
The supporters are probably watching the momentum of Tinubu’s supporters in their drive to help the party leader make up his mind for 2023.
Tinubu has yet to declare his intention, either.
