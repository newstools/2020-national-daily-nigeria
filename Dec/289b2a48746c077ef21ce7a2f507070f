Out-going US President Trump let fly on Saturday a fusillade angry tweets against the Democrat President-Elect Joe Biden, the US judiciary, and the entire American electoral process.
He didn’t even spare his Sen. Leader Mitch McConnell.
In tweets where he called Bide a fake president, the media fake news, Trump, who has had no time to respond to pressing isues in America, including the Covid-19 relief fund debacle and a suicide bombing in Nashville, said:
“If a Democrat presidential candidate had an election rigged and stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before, the Democrat senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death. Mitch and the Republicans do nothing, just want to let it pass. No fight!” Trump wrote.
“Where the hell is the Durham Report? They spied on my campaign, colluded with Russia (and others), and got caught. Read the Horowitz Reports about Comey and McCabe. Even the fake news
‪@nytimes said ‘bad’. They tried it all, and failed, so now they are trying to steal the election!
“The US Supreme Court has been totally incompetent and weak on the massive election fraud that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election. We have absolute proof, but they don’t want to see it – No ‘standing’, they say. If we have corrupt elections, we have no country!
“A young military man working in Afghanistan told me that elections in Afghanistan are far more secure and much better run than the USA’s 2020 Election. Ours, with its millions and millions of corrupt Mail-In Ballots, was the election of a third world country. Fake President!”
Aside from losing the Nov 3 election, Trump has lost all his effort to discredit the election across the US courts, and even filed to sway the electoral college.
The last hurdle is the January 6 Congress decision before inauguration in February.
