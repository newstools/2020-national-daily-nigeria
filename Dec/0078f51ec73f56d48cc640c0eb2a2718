Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Wednesday promised that the National Assembly will pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by the first quarter of 2021.
Lawan at a public hearing on the repeal of the Electoral Act 2010 and enactment of the 2020 Electoral Act on Wednesday affirmed that the National Assembly will work to make this possible so that the amended 2020 Electoral Act will be tested in early elections to gauge its effectiveness.
The former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, at the hearing advocated the amendment of electronic voting to be expanded to include electronic transmission of votes.
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, noted that electronic voting may fail in rural areas, arguing that the votes of the people there must be made to count.
Meanwhile, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill in November passed second reading in the House of Representatives.
