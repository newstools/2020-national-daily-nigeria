To head off any attempt by organisers of the ENDSARS movement planning to resume protest in Lagos December 7, the federal government has deployed police and army in the Lekki area of Lagos.
The deployment took place last night.
And that followed an official statement by Lagos police chief Hakeem Odumosu, who warn parents and guardians to warn their children planning to resume the October protest that turned bloody.
The federal government warned much earlier it would never stand pat and watch the ENDSARS movement organize protest again in Nigeria.
Efforts have been on to freeze the account of those associated with the protest funding, as it initiate legal proceeding against the identified faces of the protest.
The state response to the protest degeneration led to many death and break down of law and order across the nation, with Lagos particularly hit.
Motorists working the Lekki axis have reported the toll gate area, where the protesters occupied for 12 days in October, has been manned by security agents.
