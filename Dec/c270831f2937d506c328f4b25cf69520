Another Nigerian woman has received the Covid-19 vaccine and she said afterwards that she has “never wanted a vaccine so bad”.

Dr Adaora Okolo, who is one of the medics at the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus, has received her first shot and is waiting for the second.

Sharing a photo of her getting the jab, she said: “I just got my first shot of #PfizerCOVIDvaccine.

“I have never wanted a vaccine so much. I am grateful for this huge stride and hope that we can fairly distribute the vaccines to communities that have been hit hard.”

This comes after a Nigerian medical doctor revealed she was one of the first 100 to receive the Covid-19 vaccine in Ohio.
