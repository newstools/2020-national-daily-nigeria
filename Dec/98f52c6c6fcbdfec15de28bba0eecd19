The All Progressives Congress (APC) will hold an emergency meeting of its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Tuesday, December 8, 2020, as crisis prolongs over the extension of the tenure of the National Caretaker Committee.
The National Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, has sent formal invitation to APC NEC members. Akpanudoedehe in the invitation explained that the meeting will “review the Party’s position and set agenda for the party’s next move,” which subtly relates to the intention for the extension of the tenure of the caretaker Committee led by Governor Bini of Yobe State. This crisis also includes the legal suit by the members of the dissolved APC National Working Committee (NWC), led by deposed Adams Oshiomhole.
“In line with the COVID-19 public health protocols, the meeting which has been slated for 11.00am at the Council Chamber, State House, Abuja, will be held virtually,” Akpanudoedehe declared.
