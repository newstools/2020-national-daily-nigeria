A New York doctor was diagnosed with the coronavirus four days after he received the first dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, Ynet reported.
The case occurred at Montefiore Hospital in New York.
“One of our team members started to feel symptoms about four days after he got the vaccine,” said Dr. Amos Dudi, an intensive care and lung disease specialist at the hospital. “We are not sure when exactly he was infected, it may have even been before he received the vaccine or it could be after then.”
Dr. Dudi emphasized that the Pfizer vaccine does not achieve its full effect of protection from the coronavirus until the second dose has been administered, 21 days after the first dose is given.
“We do not expect to be immune to the virus before that. It is precisely this period of time between the two vaccine doses is the period of time in which people should be careful and not be complacent. I myself was vaccinated 11 days ago, and that does not stop me from putting on a mask and being as cautious as I was before that. On the contrary, I may be even a little more cautious.”
Dr. Dudi stressed that the vaccine is not the cause of the doctor testing positive for the disease. “In practice this is impossible. The test tests for a genetic material that cannot be detected as a result of the vaccine. We do not see any connection between the test and the vaccine itself.”
Israel has provided vaccines to approximately 380,000 citizens so far, Health Minister Yuli Ederlstein announced Monday. The Jewish State began its third lockdown Sunday evening in response to rising morbidity rates.
