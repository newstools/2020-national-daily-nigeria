Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 and SGF Boss Mustapha has gone into isolation.
He disclosed on Sunday that some members of his family exposed to the infection have tested positive—the reason he and his wife had to quarantine themselves.
Both have tested negative so far.
“I would like to inform the general public that some members of my household tested positive for COVID-19 yesterday evening.
“Although they are currently asymptomatic, they have been isolated and are receiving care in one of the government treatment centres.
“My wife and I tested negative, but will remain in self-isolation and work from home according to protocols by the health authorities,” he said.
Mustapha seized the opportunity to remind Nigerians the virus is real, urging them to adhere to all public health and safety measures to avoid losing the gains already made in the fight against COVID-19.
“As a family, we covet your prayers. Please Take Responsibility for yourself and to protect our country,” he said.
