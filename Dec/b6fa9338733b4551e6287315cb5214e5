The Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina who was declared wanted after jumping bail, has been extradited back to Nigeria from Niger Republic.
He was arrested on Monday by a combined team of the Nigerian Police Force, International Criminal Police Organisation National Central Bureau, Abuja, in collaboration with their Nigerien counterparts after he fled the country to seek refuge in Niger Republic.
It would be recalled that Maina, who is facing 12-count of money laundering to the tune of N2 billion by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, jumped bail forcing the trial judge, Justice Abang Okon to issue an arrest warrant against him.
It was gathered that Maina has been brought to Abuja by the Nigerian Police and detained pending his arraignment in court. He will also be handed over to the EFCC after interrogation by the police.
DCP Frank Mba, Force Public Relations Officer, had said following the arrest of Maina in Niamey, Niger Republic, that the Nigeria Police Force was perfecting extradition processes of the fugitive to Nigeria to enable him face trial in pending criminal proceedings against him.
He said Maina, who was declared wanted by a court of competent jurisdiction, was arrested last night, 30th November, 2020 through the collaborative efforts of the operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, INTERPOL NCB, Abuja and their Nigerien counterpart.
His trial continued last week in absentia.
