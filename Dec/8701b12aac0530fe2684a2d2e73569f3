Zamfara’es-Gov. Sani Yerima, has dismissed the APC gentleman agreement on zoning, and will be contesting the 2023 presidential election after waiting for President Muhammadu Buhari to complete his term.
Yerima made his intention known at a press conference in Abuja on Wdensday.
“You may recall that in 2006, I declared my interest to contest for presidency after having served Zamfara State for a period of eight years.
“However, I decided to withdraw for the current President at that time and since then I went to Senate for three terms. Now that Mr. President is completing his second term, I decided to try again to see what God will have for me having voluntarily decided not to go to the Senate again.”
On zoning, Yerima said there is nothing like agreement.
You can ask Mr President, he led the group. Asiwaju was there. I was part of it. there was no meeting. Agreement can’t be verbal, it has to be written.”
APC’s national leader Bola Tinubu is another party stlwart whos ambition, not declared yet, is already making waves across Nigeria.
Sani will be hogging the headlines again with his ambition, having gone silent for years following series of controversies, including the introduction of Sharia, marrying a young Egyptian teen, and other that regularly trailed is terms as governor and senator.
