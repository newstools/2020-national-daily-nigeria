There are emerging indications of tension in the north as a Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) was said to have threatened mass protests of the bandits’ invasion of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, and kidnapping over 600 students. The groups had warned that if the government fails to rescue the missing students kidnapped during the invasion of the Government Science Secondary School Kankara, by bandits, their members will take to the streets.
The Northwest Coordinator of the Coalition, Jamilu Aliyu Charanchi, was said to have at a press briefing in Katsina, vowed that thousands of protesters will be mobilised if the school pupils are not rescued as soon as possible.
Jamilu Aliyu Charanchi had declared: “Failure of the government to rescue the missing students within the shortest period of time, CNG will not hesitate to mobilise hundreds of thousands on the streets of Katsina State on a series of protest until the students are fully rescued.
“This will happen even if it’s going to cost us our lives.”
The coalition berated President Muhammadu Buhari for not visiting the affected school, despite being in the state for a private visit.
The coalition ridiculed the Buhari administration that the bandits attack on the school exposes not only the weakness of the government but also “lack of its concern to the educational sector.”
The coalition scolded the government for being “inhuman, insensitive, ungodly and barbaric.”
The northern groups demanded immediate action, including the closure of all boarding secondary schools and the immediate deployment of security personnel to all secondary schools within the state.
