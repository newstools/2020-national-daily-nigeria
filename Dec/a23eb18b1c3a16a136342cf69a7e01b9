President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed his administration will deal decisively with “any act of hooliganism hiding behind peaceful protests.”
He said this Monday when the ENDSARS protesters were mobilizing for the second phase of the protest that rocked Nigeria in October.
“I want to reiterate our government’s commitment to the rights of citizens to embark on peaceful protests,” he said at Aso Rock Villa while virtually declaring open the 2020 Chief of Army Staff’s Conference 2020 on Monday.
He added such protest must be done responsibly in accordance with the laws of the land.
“I also want to state that any act of hooliganism hiding behind the peaceful protests, will be highly dealt with decisively to ensure the peace and stability of our nation, he warned.
Buhari also commended the Nigeria Army for their efforts to swiftly restore law and order in many states during the last scale of criminality that ensued in the wake of the EndSARS protests.
