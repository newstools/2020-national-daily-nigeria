Gunmen during the Christmas festivities dared the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, ridiculing the south east security outfit he set up recently in the zone. The gunmen, putting the Nnamdi Kanu’s security structure to test, had kidnapped the Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Moses Chikwe, and his driver. The gunmen were said to have kidnapped the priest and his driver at the World Bank zone of Owerri, Imo State.
The gunmen were said to have operated unchallenged and had gone before the security agencies in the state could get knowledge of the operation.
The vehicle of the Priest was said to be abandoned in front of the Archdiocesean Headquarters, Owerri, hours after the operation.
It was gathered that the Public Relations Officer of the Imo State Police Command, Orlando Ikeokwu, acknowledging the kidnap, noted that an official report of the kidnapping was yet to be made at any of the police formations in the State. He, however, said that the Commissioner of Police in the state, Isaac Akinmoyede, has activated the tactical units of the Command to rescue the kidnapped priest and his driver.
The PPRO enjoined the public, essentially, the Catholic Mission to be calm, promising that the Command is working to ensure the quick release of the Auxiliary Bishop and his driver.
Hours after the kidnap, the Nnamdi Kanu security structure for the southeast has not been noticed to be taking any action or responding to the incident.
It was indicated that the kidnapped priest, Chikwe, is expected to succeed the Catholic Archbishop of Owerri, Vincent Obinna, on his retirement in 2021.
