PDP Rep Kingsley Chinda did a solo mission weeks ago by calling for President Muhammadu Buhari’s presence in the House. The mission ws aborted by the APC majority. Now that calamity struck close to Buhari’s hometown in Katsina, Chinda has got a sting in his voice.
““The president should be impeached over the growing insecurity in the country,” the caucus leader said on Thursday as he mobilized the PDP caucus in the House—in response to the abduction of 333 schoolboys at Kankara, Katsina on Friday.
While Katsina Gov Aminu Masari said 333 children are still missing, Boko Haram, claiming responsibility for the attack, said they are holding 523 boys hostage somewhere in the thicket of Zamfara.
The fear has driven neighboring states—Kano, Sokoto, Zamfrar—to shut down schools and most of other places where numbers  matter if there is any incident.
The call for Buhari’s impeachment follows the cancellation of his visit to the lower chamber, having agreed initially.
