Bishop Hassan Kukah and President Muhammadu Buhari are getting a lot of things mixed up between them. Some believe the two need to get on the same page, and Bayelsa former Sen Ben Bruce has offered to make piece.
The Bishop of Sokoto Diocese has been getting criticism since his Christmas day bobing of President Muhammadu Buhari and his, according to Kukah, nepotistic government.
The speech has divided the north, with some for and others against the holy father.
The Christian Association of Nigeria, Catholic Church, Middle Belt Leaders, among others have backed Kukah.
MURIC, the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, and others have called him out, urging him to go contest in PDP or other parties instead of abusing the pulpit.
But Bruce, who described himself as a Catholic is trying to make peace. “. The religious faith in Nigeria is vital to our coexistence and must be seen as such. I, therefore, offer myself to bring together Bishop Kukah and President @MBuhari in the interest of Nigeria for a better understanding of each other,” he tweeted.
