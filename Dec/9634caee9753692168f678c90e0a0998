Oil prices fell by over three percent on Monday as a rapidly spreading new COVID-19 strain that has shut down much of the United Kingdom triggered worries about a slower recovery in fuel demand.
Brent crude, the benchmark for Nigeria’s oil grades, dipped by $1.74 or 3.3 percent to $50.52 per barrel at 08:45 West Africa Time while United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude declined by $1.66 or 3.4 percent to $47.44, having risen by 1.5 percent on Friday to its highest point since February.
Bonny Light, Nigeria’s principal oil grade, gained $0.73 or 1.43 percent on Friday to close at $51.74 a barrel.
But Qua Iboe, another major national oil grade, shed $0.28 or 0.54 percent to close at $51.49.
Monday’s drop in oil prices followed seven weeks of gains boosted by hopes of rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.
“The oil market has been on a bull trend in the past month or so, ignoring negative factors, amid an optimism that a widening vaccine rollout would revive global growth,” said Kazuhiko Saito, chief analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi Co.
“But investors’ rosy expectations for 2021 have suddenly vanished due to a new variant of the virus.”
