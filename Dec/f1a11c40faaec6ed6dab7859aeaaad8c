The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday chided President Muhammadu Buhari over the increasing rate of insecurity in the country. PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, at the inauguration of new road projects in Bauchi State on Wednesday bemoaned the inability of the President to tackle the nation’s security crisis.
Secondus lamented that Nigeria is in distress, declaring that President Buhari has failed to tackle the lingering insecurity, pointing out the various killings and destruction of property in the north, including the economy that is in recession.
Secondus stated: “Just a week ago, over 40 farmers were killed in Borno State. Is Nigeria not in distress? What else do you what me to describe?
“The economy is bad, security is bad, virtually every facet of the Nigerian life has collapsed. What else do you want to hear? You know more than we know.
“You better let the world know and those in authority. All we are saying is that let President Buhari release the Katsina boys for us. We are in pains.”
The PDP National Chairman was of the view that President Buhari has left the country worse than he met it, saying that if he were in his shoes, he would declare a state of emergency on security in the country and change the entire security architecture.
Over 100 bandits had invaded the Government Science Secondary School in Ƙanƙara Local Government Area, Katsina State, kidnapping over 333 students, according to Governor Aminu Masari’s estimate.
