The Nigeria Police Force on Thursday extradited fugitive Abdulrashid Abdullahi Maina, former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), on Thursday from Niamey, Niger Republic, to Nigeria. He had absconded to Niger Republic jumping bail and running away from prosecution in a suit of N2 billion pension fund fraud. Maina was arrested having been declared wanted by a court of competent jurisdiction over the pending criminal trial against him.
 
Abdulrashid Maina was arrested on 30th November 2020 through the collaborative efforts of the operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, INTERPOL NCB, Abuja, and their Nigerien counterpart. The team from INTERPOL Nigeria, led by the Commissioner of Police INTERPOL, CP Garba Umar, having completed the necessary documentation requirements and other extradition processes, flew the wanted former Pension Fund Chairman, Maina, into Nigeria aboard an NPF Jet 5N-HAR and landed at exactly 1417Hrs (Nigerian Time).
 
Meanwhile, the Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, applauding the trans-national/inter-agency collaborations that led to the successful arrest and extradition of the wanted fugitive, assured that necessary legal actions will follow immediately.
The trial of fugitive Maina resumed on Friday and the court sent him to Kuje Prison, Abuja, on appearance.
