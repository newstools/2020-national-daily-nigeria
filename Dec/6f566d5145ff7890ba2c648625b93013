The United Kingdom has disclaimed a member of parliament that garbled out how former President Yakubu Gowo looted half of Nigeria’s treasury and moved it to the UK.
The British government response followed a petition by the Igbo for a Progressive Nigeria (IPAN), demanding details about the allegation Tom Tugendhat made during a debate to sanction Nigeria over the handling of the ENDSARS protest.
“Some people will remember when General Gowon left Nigeria with half of the Central Bank, so it is said, and moved to London,” he said.
Tugendhat, a former military officer and intelligent agents in Afghanistan, Lebanon, and other Arabic country, was a youngster when Gowon was president. The 47-year-old also has degrees in theology and Islamic studies.
But with parliamentary immunity and tacit encouragement of Nigerian-British lawmakers who were pushing the petition, Tugenhadt could say anything.
Replying IPAN’s petition in a letter dated December 21 and signed by a member of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Nigeria Unit, one Angela disclosed that Tom Tugendhat made the statement in his own personal capacity, and not for the British Parliament or United Kingdom.
Angela said: “Thank you for your email of 29 November to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office about the debate on Nigeria.
“I am replying as a member of the FCDO Nigeria Unit. I recognise there is concern about the comments made by Tom Tugendhat MP about former Nigerian Head of State, General Gowon, during the Westminster Hall debate on 23 November.
“I would like to clarify that Mr Tugendhat was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the UK Government.
“The High Commissioner has written to the Nigerian Foreign Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, as well as to General Gowon, to reiterate this point. Yours Sincerely, Angela.”
