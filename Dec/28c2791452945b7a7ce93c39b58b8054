While encouraging the 344 Katsina schoolboys rescued from kidnappers’ den in Zamfara on Friday, President Muhammadu Buhari told the kids to count themselves lucky studying science—unlike those studying English and history who have no relevance in the modern world.
“The future is brighter for science and technology students like you than those who read History and English,” the president said in Hausa language.
He addressed the students alongside Governor Aminu Masari at the Katsina State Government House on Friday.
“Forget what happened, at the end of the day, you will succeed,” he said while quoting a Hausa proverb that “those who are patient are successful and satisfy people.”
Sharing his own experience, he narrated how education got him the opportunity to become a governor, minister, president and prisoner.
“I later ventured into politics, I went to the Supreme Court three times before God in his infinite mercy made me the president.
“I just came from home (Daura). I have relations that didn’t go to school and their cows have finished and there is not enough land for farming. Me that went to school, see where God brought me.
“For this reason, you have to go to school and acquire education, including religious knowledge to the best of your ability so that you can know how to interact with the larger world and your immediate families,”Buhari said.
His pep talk must have been informed by the claims by Boko Haram after the Kankara science schoolboys were kidnapped.
The group said, falsely, they abducted the boys because the western education the government is giving them is anti-Islam.
“I personally came to see you and rejoice with you after your release from this calamity. I am happy with how the Katsina governor handled the situation leading to your release.
“Try your best and study hard and succeed, I am committed toward building a better Nigeria for you,” he added.
