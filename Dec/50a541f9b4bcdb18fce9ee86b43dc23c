Arik Air has leased a Boeing 737-700 aircraft from Eznis Airways to boost its operations. The aircraft arrived in Nigeria on November 21, 2020.
The leased aircraft which will be deployed into service from December 2, 2020 will enable Arik Air return to some routes which were suspended at the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is expected that the aircraft will boost Arik Air’s fleet in readiness for the Yuletide season.
The Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air, Captain Roy Ilegbodu said: “We are pleased to announce the additional airplane to boost our operations and ensure we provide seamless and efficient service to our customers in this season”.
