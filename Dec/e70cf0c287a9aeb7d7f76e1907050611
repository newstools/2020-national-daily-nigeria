Kidnapping has become a recurring incidence in Edo State, and takes place almost every day in several parts of the state. Mrs. Comfort Chinaza Nwaka, manager of Easy Way Supermarket along Lucky Way, Benin City, had been kidnapped on Sunday afternoon by gunmen.  Mrs. Nwaka was intercepted along Lucky Way at Ikpoba Hill, Benin City, at about 11.10am and was taken away to an unknown destination by her abductors.
The incidence of kidnapping is becoming uncontrollable in Edo State since the @EndSARS protest and calculated attacks on the Nigerian Police, including police facilities by hoodlums who hijacked the peaceful protest.
On Friday, three farmers were kidnapped at Okpelle, Edo State, by gunmen. They were on their way to the farm when the abductors apprehended them and whisked them away at gun point.
A member of the Edo State House of Assembly was on Saturday kidnapped along Benin-Agbor road at gun point. His whereabouts is still unknown.
Edo State is becoming inhabitable for law abiding citizens, as men of the underworld have taken control in perpetuating crimes and violence in the society without interruption.
Stakeholders are of the view that Governor Godwin Obaseki has a herculean task over the new wave of crime in the state. Others emphasized that it is time for south-south governors to rise to the challenge in establishing regional security structures as has been done in the southwest, southeast and some other parts of the country.
