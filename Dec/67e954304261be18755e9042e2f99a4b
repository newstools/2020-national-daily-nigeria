The year 2020, as it comes to an end in less than 48 hours, was replete with laughable scandals that added some humour to the economic and security woes that bedeviled the country in the course of the year.
In May, the Chairman and CEO of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, and the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, got into a public fight over an office space with Dabiri-Erewa accusing the Minister of preying on her and her staff.
In June, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), was engulfed in a crisis that led to the Adams Oshiomhole’s NWC being dissolved.
In July, Aso Rock Villa, the seat of power in Nigeria, was engulfed in a crisis of monumental dimension when the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, had an all-out altercation with President Muhammadu Buhari’s Private Secretary and nephew, Sabiu Yusuf.
In July, former acting-Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, was arrested after the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, recommended that he should be fired for alleged corruption and insubordination.
Also in July, former acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Professor Kemebradikumo Pondei, rounded off the month by ‘collapsing’ while being interrogated by the House of Representatives when he was asked to explain how the Commission misappropriated N82.5 billion.
In November, Abdulrashid Maina, former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), was arrested in Niamey, Niger Republic, and extradited to Nigeria to face trial for allegedly laundering over N2 billion. Maina had jumped bail and fled to Niger on a motorcycle from Sokoto State.
