The United States has added Nigeria to a blacklist on religious freedom.
This is the first time Nigeria is being added to the list which paves way for potential sanctions if the country does not improve its record.
The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo described Nigeria, as a “Country of Particular Concern” for religious freedom.
Other nations in the list include China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
Pompeo tweeted on Monday, “Today, the U.S. designates Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, the DPRK, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as countries of concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for engaging systematic, ongoing, egregious religious freedom violations.”
His tweet added that America is unwavering in its commitment to religious freedom.
“No country or entity should be allowed to persecute people with impunity because of their beliefs. These annual designations show that when religious freedom is attacked, we will act.”
