Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State in his 2020 Christmas message advocated religious tolerance towards peace and unity in Nigeria and across the world. The governor was of the view that Nigeria and the international communities will be at peace if Christians live within the tenets of Christianity as preached by Jesus Christ whose birth was being celebrated on Friday across the world. Okowa, therefore, enjoined all to learn to tolerate other people’s religious beliefs, political leanings, and cultural affiliations by living in peace and showing respect to one another.
Governor Okowa in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, highlighted the virtues of Christianity as espoused by Jesus Christ to include peaceful coexistence, love, tolerance and sacrifice, noting: “hence, Christmas was a celebration to mark the birth of Jesus Christ; it should be an opportunity for Christians to strive and emulate the life of Christ.”
The governor articulated that a true Christian should not be associated with communal and religious clashes, armed robbery, kidnapping, militancy, armed banditry, terrorism and other vices threatening the country and parts of the world.
