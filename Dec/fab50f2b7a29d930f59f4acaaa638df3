The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday declared two ad-hoc staff were missing, their whereabouts were unknown by the commission at the end of the Saturday by-election in Zamfara State which was declared inconclusive.
The Zamfara by-election outcome raised fresh fears over Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu in improving on his competence after the confirmation of his re-appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari for a second tenure. Some stakeholders in the country had expressed the fear of the INEC chairman improving on his competence during his second term having noted the incidence of inconclusive elections during his first term in office, which in some cases derailed the choices of the people in the elections.
Professor Ibrahim Magawata, INEC Returning Officer, had declared the Saturday by-election in Bakura constituency, Zamfara State, inconclusive, explaining that results of five polling units in Bakura ward had been cancelled. The RO, Professor Magawata, said that a total of 11,429 votes were affected in the cancellation.
In the results released, the Returning Officer indicated that the PDP candidate, Ibrahim Tudu, 18,645 votes, while the APC candidate, Bello Dankande Gamji, had 16, 464 votes.
The commission is yet to fix a new date for the runoff election to complete the process.
