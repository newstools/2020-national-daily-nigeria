Abuja and Lagos, in that order, have begun to rack up figures of highest infection rates as the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic spread across Nigeria.
According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, on Tuesday, 999 Covid infections were recorded, the highest single-day figure since March.
The rising tide has made the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 declare restrictions and re-impose fading protocols.
The current phase of restriction ends on January 18, 2021.
