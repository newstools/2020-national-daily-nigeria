President Muhammadu Buhari has failed to honour the invitation by the House of Representatives to address them on the security situation in the country despite his earlier assurance that he would appear before the lawmaker.
The House in a resolution on 1 December invited Buhari to address them on the true state of the security situation in the country, in the wake of the killings of 78 rice farmers by Boko Haram.
The invitation was delivered to the President by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila and other leaders.
But at the commencement of plenary on Thursday, there was no sight of President Buhari.
Reps Solomon Bob from Rivers State raised a point of order over the President’s no-show. He asked the Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila to update the House.
In response, Gbajabiamila said the House will wait for official communication from the President.
The President’s refusal to show up may have been because of the advisory by Justice Minister and Attorney General Abubakar Malami.
He issued a statement on Wednesday, saying the National Assembly has no right to invite Buhari.
His comment has been roundly debunked by several senior lawyers.
