The audio of Boko Hara claiming responsibility for the abduction of hundreds of schoolboys at Kankara, Katsina, is a fake after all.
Defence Headquarters, Abuja, said the terrorists are merely looking for credit, their way of instilling fear in the populace.
“On the basis of the characteristics of terrorists all over the world from the time of Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Al-Shabaab, all of them, wherever they will boost their ego or show relevance, that is what they will do, said Deefence Media Coordinator Maj. Gen John Enenche.
“What did they even do? Somebody spoke on audio and said, ‘I am Shekau.’ Shekau on a secondary note is a brand. All that needs to be done is somebody using his voice. The total aim of terrorists is to instil fear into people even beyond their scope of influence.
“So, it is easy for the layman to agree that it is them (Boko Haram) because even if it is kidnappers or armed robbers, they aim to instil fear and kill.”
Initialb report of the Dec. 12 incident stated the kidnappers are bandit who stormed the secondary school by 10 pm, killig a police officer and stealing about 333 boys.
Three days later, an audio, first published by HumAngle, said the northeastern jihadists claimed responsibility for the first incident of Boko Haram terrorism in the northwest.
They also denied the statement by Katsina Gov Aminu Masari that the kidnappers were in touch with the government and negotiation for the hostage release was underway.
Enence added that “with what the military is doing, by the grace of Almighty God, very soon, the children will be back.”
