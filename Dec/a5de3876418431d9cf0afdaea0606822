The duo had a meeting with Debby at the presidential palace in N’Djamena, which was also attended by Chadian ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Abakar Saleh Chahaimi.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, he said;

“I am here in Chad to see our people currently taking refuge at The Darsalam camp in Baga Sola. We met them on Wednesday. Our people are doing very well. The government of Chad is taking care of them. So I am here to express appreciation to the President for his generosity towards our people here in Chad. We have also discussed how we can voluntarily repatriate our people back to Nigeria. Basically we are here for three things: meet our people, thank the government of Chad and intensify collaborative efforts to repatriate those who are willing to be safely resettled in different parts of Borno.”
