Popular messaging Application Whatsapp has announced that from January 1, 2021, many users of old versions of Android and iPhones will no longer be able to access Whatsapp and Facebook on their phones.
The decision which would definitely affect millions of users worldwide will also give some users the opportunity to upgrade their phones operating systems to be able to access the world’s most popular messaging application.
Those whose phones do not have the facility to update will however completely lose access and will have to get new phones.
All iPhones operating on iOS 9 or newer, or any Android phone not using at least 4.0.3 OS will no longer be able to open or operate the Facebook-owned app.
What this invariably means is that all iPhone models from the lowest to iPhone 4 will be unable to access WhatsApp, because they are incapable of updating to iOS 9.
Meanwhile, owners of iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S have the opportunity to update to the operating system so as not to be affected.
Phone owners can see what software their device is using by checking the settings section. For iPhone users, this can be found under Settings > General > Software update.
The move is expected to affect over 5 million phone users worldwide.
Some of the phones to be affected include Apple iPhone 1-4; Samsung Galaxy S2; HTC Desire; LG Optimus Black; Motorola Droid Razr and any Android released before 2010
