A week after their abduction, 344 Kankara Secondary School boys have returned to Katsina after the military and the state government negotiated with the kidnappers who took them to Tsafe in Zamfara.
The students, most them still in their school uniforms, were escorted into the state capital by security operatives, and later led to a hall in the Government House to meet Gov. Aminu Masari.
Masari had on Thursday night confirmed the release of 344 abducted schoolboys by bandits, dismissing the claim by Boko Haram that there was no negotiation whatsoever going on. According to him, the government was able to get through to the bandits through the local Miyetti Allah, the umbrella body for Fulani cattle breeders.
The terrorist group had earlier claimed responsibility in a video for the kidnap, saying it did it because the western education the boys are receiving are not in line with Islam.
The Defence Headquarters also said the Boko Haram and is leader Shekau were just spreading propaganda and fear with the fake video.
On their return, Masari saidthe schoolboys would receive proper medical attention before they are reunited with their families.
