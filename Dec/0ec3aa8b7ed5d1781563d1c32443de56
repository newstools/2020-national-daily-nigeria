Former Borno Gov Kashim Shettima made a motion for the dismissal of Nigeria’s security service chiefs, replacement with new ones, and the Senate has adopted the motion.
The Tuesday decision made the third—in a row this year—calling for the sack of the security brass.
The call came following the murder of 43 rice farmers in Borno by terrorists.
The federal lawmakers also call for a probe into allegations of corruption in the forces, a joint multinational alliance with Niger and Cameroon, and mass recruitment into the police and the army.
Nigeria last week witnessed instances of notable break down of security as bandits, herdsmen, and terrorists killed citizens in the southwest, the  northeast and the northwest.
