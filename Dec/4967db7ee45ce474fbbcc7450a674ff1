In recognition of its continued game-changing innovations in the malt industry, Nigeria’s leading malt brand – Maltina, has been recognized as the “Malt Drink Brand of the Year” at the just concluded BrandCom Awards 2020.

The award is yet another honour recognizing the brand’s ingenuity in the expansion and diversification of their malt portfolio, most recently through the introduction of two new and exciting variants – Maltina Vanilla and Maltina Pineapple. Additionally, the brand is being lauded for its unique contribution to the lives of Nigerians through initiatives like the Maltina School Games, Maltina Teacher of the Year Awards, and Ramadan with Maltina.

Commenting on the noteworthy achievement, the Portfolio Manager, Non-alcoholic brands, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Kehinde Kadiri, said, “We are delighted to receive this award and to be recognized for not just our contributions to the malt industry but also for our social activities which have spread happiness to millions of Nigerians.”

“This award serves as an encouragement for us to continue in our quest for customer satisfaction while providing value for Nigerians at large” she concluded.

The two new variants, which are built on the campaign, “Own the Flavour”, invite consumers to express themselves uniquely, while enjoying the Maltina flavours.

As part of their marketing campaign to launch the two new variants, Maltina would also be commencing a flavour tour around the country. Consumers can find the route to the tour on the brand website or join the conversation on social media.
