The Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, has directed immediate investigations into a suit purportedly challenging the legality of the Statesâ€™ Judicial Panel of Inquiry, investigating allegations of citizens against officers of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).
The IGP, who gave the order on the heels of trending reports in the media, on Thursday expressed the disapproval of the Force Management Team on the matter and ordered investigations into the alleged role of the Force Legal Section including its Head.
Meanwhile, the Force Legal Officer has been queried and may face further sanctions if found guilty of dereliction of duty.
The IGP reiterated the commitment of the Force to fulfilling all its obligations with regards to the disbandment of the SARS, the ongoing Judicial Panels and all other police reforms.
