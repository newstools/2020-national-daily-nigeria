Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State on Sunday countered the failed state status of Nigeria despite obvious statistics that validates the Nigerian situation. The Nasarawa State governor condemned the report of an international publication which denoted Nigeria as drifting towards a failed state. However, the report is belated and imprecise as it was being done after am earlier rating report showed that Nigeria ranks third on global scale of failed states.
However, Governor Sule on Channels Television programme, Sunday Politics, argued that the report of Nigeria being a failed state was borne out of ignorance and a deliberate ploy to dent the image of the nation.
The governor admitted that things are not working in the country as anticipated from the leaders of the country but in contradiction claimed that there is improvement, saying that although much more still needs to be done, especially, in the area of security, the country has significantly improved.
Unfortunately, Governor Sule’s significant improvement anti-thetically betrays the noticeable leadership failures and associated two successive economic recessions in five years, the intractable insecurity across the country – the perennial Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast, ravaging bandits in the northwest and north central, devastating Fulani herdsmen invading rural communities, kidnapping across Nigeria, amongst other indices.
Some stakeholders of good will in the Nigerian project were of the view that either the Nasarawa State governor, Sule, is ignorant of the realities in Nigeria, or the governor is simply mischievous to please the grand leader of his All Progressives Congress (APC) party government, President Muhammadu Buhari, in his assertion, just as APC governors did.
