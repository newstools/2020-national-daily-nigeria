Pat Robertson, televangelist and strong conservative backer of President Donald Trump has advised the President to snap out of living in what he described as an “alternate reality”.
“With all his talent, and the ability to raise money and draw large crowds, the President still lives in an alternate reality,” Robertson said recently on “The 700 Club.”
Explaining that sort of reality, Robertson said people think Trump lies about most things.
“But he isn’t lying. To him, that’s the truth.”
But the conservative preacher, who once said anybody revolting against Trump was revolting against God’s plan for America, now believes his candidate is “very erratic”.
“He’s fired people, he’s fought people and he’s insulted people, and he keeps going down the line. So it’s a mixed bag,” Robertson said of the President.
“And I think it would be well to say, ‘You’ve had your day and it’s time to move on.'”
And on the Trump administration’s effort to upturn President-Elect Joe Biden’s victory, Robertson thinks there’s not much to expect.
“I had prayed and hoped that there might be some better solution, but I think it’s all over,” he said.
Robertson had earlier claimed God told him Trump would win the 2020 election.
“I think the Electoral College has spoken. I think the Biden corruption has not totally been brought to fruition, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting the Electoral College and I don’t think the Supreme Court is going to move in to do anything and I think we’re going to see a President (Joe) Biden, and I also think we’ll be seeing as President Kamala Harris not too long after the inauguration of President Biden.”
The preacher also dismissed the speculation Trump is coming back in 2024.
“I think it’s a sideshow. I think it would be a mistake. My money would be on Nikki Haley. I think she’d make a tremendous candidate for the Republican Party,” he said.
