The Lagos state government says anybody who violates the 12 am to 4 am curfew imposed by the Federal Government and other protocols in the name of attending cross-over service in the state would be fined up to N500, 000 when caught.
The government emphasised that all churches in the state must respect the curfew in place and avoid physical crossover services and large gatherings on December 31, 2020.
Recall that the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, last week directed worship centres to suspend all-night services, including vigils and crossover events, noting that the Federal Government imposed a curfew between 12 midnight and 4 am would be strictly enforced.
This is part of the emergency measure being employed by the government to halt the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic as the governor also urged religious leaders to ensure their followers observe the protocols put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
