A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Chris Finebone has joined other stakeholders in berating Governor  Nyesom Wike of Rivers State over plan to set up Task Force on control  of borders to strengthen the battle to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state.
Finebone in a statement cautioned that the plan is another policy error of the Rivers State governor, warning that it will members of the task force to danger.
The APC chieftain acknowledged that security agencies may disappoint in their duties sometimes, he argued that their disappointment is not enough reason for anyone to resort to self-help. He advised Governor Wike to continue to work with security agencies to enforce the lockdown order at the borders.
Finebone in the statement declared: “It will be another misstep on the part of the governor to embark on such dangerously ignorant line of action. More so, it will amount to exposing innocent young men who will constitute the boundary task force to enormous danger.
“There is no doubt that our security agencies sometime falter when needed most. But that should not be a reason to resort to self-help.
“Let the governor continue to work with security agents towards enforcing boundary lockdown. Opening another flank of faceoff with the federal security agencies at this time is highly unnecessary. It is even more needless to create a situation that will endanger the lives of innocent young men in the name of task force on borders.”
