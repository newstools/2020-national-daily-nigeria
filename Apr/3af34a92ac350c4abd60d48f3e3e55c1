The leadership role of the nation’s maritime industry in the fight against COVID-19 was further consolidated as the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), a non-profit making organization driven by professional and industry passion splash Government and stakeholders cash gifts as timely palliative.

The NAGAFF Secretary-General, Dipo Olayokun who indicated that the gesture was in furtherance of the body’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and obligation to the nation, confirmed the donation of N500, 000 to Federal Government COVID-19 body; N350, 000 to the Lagos State Government; and the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Against (ANLCA), N100,000 and other beneficiaries.
Speaking further, the NAGAFF scribe described the fight against COVID-19 as a collective one, in which everyone must be involved.
The gesture, he maintained was, therefore, to also appreciate the dedicated commitment of Government and stakeholders in the COVID-19 war.
“May we re-emphasis, that the fight against COVID-19 should be a collective effort, and that no stone should be left unturned in this regard”, he said, noting that the donation was “In line with our obligation and commitment towards ensuring operational efficiency and wellbeing of the port users across the ports, as contained in the status book, by extending CSR to fellow stakeholders”.
“Accordingly, we do stress that only the living and healthy can carry out business functions beyond COVID-19, hence the need to keep safe and secured”, he also said, urging the concerned, listed stakeholders to contact the situation room of NAGAFF headquarters.
“NAGAFF wishes to reiterate its official position that freight forwarders who do not have any business in the port are requested to stay at home, while those who have official business engagement in the ports should do so with total adherence to the stipulated precautionary measures by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the directive of the government, through its relevant agencies.
“The NAGAFF therefore called on all well-meaning critical stakeholders at the port industry to rise to the occasion by deploying its resources towards safeguarding the ports and its users to engender the curtailing of the spread of COVID-19 pandemic”, Dipo Olayokun indicated further, commending the efforts and tenacity of the aforementioned stakeholders under the prevailing circumstances.
