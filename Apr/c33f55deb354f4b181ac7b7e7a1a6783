The sad mood over the death of Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, may subside as soon as he is committed to mother earth. Then, the power game begins to fill the vacuum created by Kyari’s demise. As a Muslim, Abba Kyari is expected to be buried the same day his death is announced. Thus, the late Chief of Staff burial is anticipated to hold on Saturday according to Muslim rites.
Meanwhile, since Kyari’s vacation from the State House, Aso Rock, Abuja, for coronavirus treatment, Babagana Kingibe, has been acting as Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari.
However, sources revealed that the appointment of a new Chief of Staff to the President may be the beginning of chaos in the Presidency.
Though, if President Buhari puts primordial pressures aside, the Deputy Chief of Staff in the Office of the Vice President could be elevated to substantive Chief of Staff to the President.
