Alleged killers of Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of the leader of Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, have been arrested after nine months of investigation.
According to the National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin on Monday, the men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian Police undertook the investigation, and arrested the suspects.
Odumakin, however, failed to state categorically if the killers are Fulani herdsmen, as the the group insisted in the wake of the killing in Ore area of the Benin-Sagamu expressway last year.
The spokesman only said three out of the four suspects arrested so far are from the northern part of the country.
“They are said to have made useful confessions to the police. We commend the dedicated officers who made the arrest just as we wait for a thorough investigation to follow,” he added.
“We have resolved to encourage the police to do their job properly. We appreciate all Nigerians who have encouraged our 94-year-old Leader in this troubling season. It is our prayer that criminals will not go unpunished again in our country.”
