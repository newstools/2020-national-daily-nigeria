Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele was recently in the news after social media went agog with fury after a video emerged of her hosting a party at her home to celebrate her husband, JJC’s birthday.
Nigerians went on an online rage, calling out the relevant authorities to act appropriately and ensure the due punishment was melted out to her and her husband over what they described as “total disregard for human safety.”
In a swift move, the Nigerian Police duly arrested her and charged her and JJC to court on Monday, April 6, 2020.
They were consequently fined N100,000 each and ordered to provide the name and phone number of all attendees at the birthday party. Funke and JJC where also ordered to proceed on a 14days isolation period in a Government facility and thereafter go on a 14days community service to public places.
In her defense, Comedian and director, Ayo Makun tweeted: “Yes! Nobody is above the law. But I wish those of you who called out @funkeakindele can do same with your countless oppressors in government… even when the sky is filled with clouds the sun still shines above. Funke will rise again.#lessonslearnt”
That tweet has infuriated a section of Nigerians who have questioned his defense. Prominent on that list is the founder of Soteria Range of Products, Tolu Balogun who disagreed with the comedian, he wrote: “This is what I find funny. This social media called out President Buhari, called out Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, called out The Slapping Senator. So pls @AYCOMEDIAN what’s your point sir?
Funke’s own hit hardest because she was in a video advising against such.”
That has lead to several people expressing their thoughts on the matter.
