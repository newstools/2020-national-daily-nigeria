The Katsina State Government announced on Friday that the wife and two children of the medical doctor, who died of COVID-19 in Daura, had tested positive to the pandemic.
The late physician, Aliyu Yakubu, had travelled to Lagos and returned to Daura after which he fell sick and was later confirmed to be infected with the virus.
He was admitted at the Nigeria Air Force Reference Hospital, Daura where he died on Saturday, April 4.
“Samples of about 23 people were taken to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control; three tested positive for COVID-19,” Governor Aminu Masari told journalists in Katsina.
He said the wife and two children had been taken to an isolation centre at the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina where they were being treated.
The first Covid-19 death in Delta also visited Lagos two weeks ago, and developed symptoms on returning to Delta, where he died almost on admission, according to Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa on April 9.
Just like Delta, contract tracing has started in Daura LGA, and a two-week lockdown begins tomorrow.
“We are still taking samples of people suspected to have had contact with the victims; we shall trace anyone that had any contact with the victims. We shall ensure that the pandemic is not spread further,” Masari said.
