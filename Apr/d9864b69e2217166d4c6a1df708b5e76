There is rising tension in Edo State as armed men on Friday evening kidnapped a commissioner in the State, Emmanuel Agbale. The commissioner was on his way to Ekpoma when his convoy was attacked along Benin – Auchi Road around Oil Palm Estate. The kidnappers killed the commissioner’s police ADC before taking away the commissioner. Barrister is the Commissioner for Education in Edo State.
The incident occurred at about 3.30pm this Friday. Many stakeholders in the state considered it unfortunate that the incident is happening when there is lockdown in the state and there are police check points at many locations on the Benin – Auchi road. It is more perturbing that only people that have exemption can be on the road; how did the perpetrators access the highway with the police on surveillance?
Meanwhile, the media aide to Governor Godwin Obaseki, Crisoe Osagie, was yet to confirm the incident when contacted on the phone at the time of this report Friday evening. He promised to confirm and call back.
Details later.
