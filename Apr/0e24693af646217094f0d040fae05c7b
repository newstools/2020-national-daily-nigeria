It’s been said that all the social media and bloggers feasted on about this matter are all centered around fake reports.
And even at that Olori Badirat Ajoke, the youngest wife of the Alaafin of Oyo, has called on the oracles in the monarch’s palace to punish her if she had an affair with Fuji musician King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal, KWAM 1.
A report had surfaced that she was sent packing from the palace after an affair with KWAM 1 was discovered by the monarch Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. The news came just months after her husband installed KWAM 1 as the Mayegun of Yorubaland.
When reached on the veracity of the report, Olori Badirat Ajoke said, “The news is actually FAKE and all the blogs that carried it will be sanctioned”.
In an Instagram video, she called on the oracles in the Alaafin of Oyo’s palace to punish her if the allegations against her are true.
