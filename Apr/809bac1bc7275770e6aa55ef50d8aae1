National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members have joined in the interventionist roles of governments to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country. They supplement government interventions in providing preventive kits to host communities.
NYSC provided over 700 face masks in addition to hundreds of hand sanitizers to traditional rulers and market women in their hoist community, Issele-Uku in Delta State.
Orientation Camps of the National Youth Service Corps were shut down by the Federal Government as one of the measures to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country.
However, the NYSC members, coming back to the camp, produced over 700 face masks and 300 sanitizer containers for distribution to residents of their hist community as their role in strengthening the war against the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria.
The State NYSC Coordinator supervised the distribution of the face mark and sanitisers at the palace of the Obi of Issele-Uku and the Obi of Idumuje Unor.
