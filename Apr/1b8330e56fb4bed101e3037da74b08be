Across the world, 95,537 people out of 1,608,075 infected by Covid-19 have died—in 210 countries—52 of them in Africa, according to Worldometer. No fewer than  358000 have recovered.
But in spite of the deathly chill blowing across the planet, a handful of countries—six of them—are still basking in the warm euphoria of an atmosphere uncontaminated with the virus.
Two of these are in Africa, others in Asia.
But the chances are slim these countries will hold out for long.
Two weeks ago, no fewer than 13 countries in Africa were untouched, and a lot more island countries in the Americas too were secured.
