One of the separated PSquare band, Paul Okoye, set social media ablaze with a debatable subject recently.

Also known by his stage name as RudeBoy, Paul raised some dusts on social media after he posted a photo with inscription that a man and a woman will remain happy in a home if the man is the one fending for the family but stated that the home will become a war zone with no private matters if the woman takes over.

Paul made the post on Instagram on the 22nd of April and a lot of celebrities and fans have joined the debate, with most women going against her.

He posted, “a man can work for 10yrs with unemployed wife and still be happy. but a woman will work 5days and the whole community will know about the unemployed husband…share if you agree”.

MMMG boss, Ubi Franklin commented on the post saying he completely agrees with the opinion but reality TV star, Kim Oprah partially disagreed with the opinion.
