The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has since the burial of late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari,  on Saturday in Abuja, begun to lose the trust and confidence of Nigerians in its coordination of the battle to contain the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria. The failure of the NCDC to control the crowd and restrict the attendees to the prescribed number of persons for public gathering,  provoked quick resentment of Nigerian citizens over the flouting of government stipulations on social distancing and minimal crowd.

Currently, mosques and churches are shur down to comply with government orders. Yet, over 800 persons gathered for the burial of late Chief of Staff who died of coronavirus, the very infection the government is struggling to prevent its spread and has locked down the entire country. Government flouting its own order under the watch of NCDC.
