Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has continued to expand health infrastructures in Lagos State to enhance government capacity to handle coronavirus cases in the state. The governor commissioned a new coronavirus isolation and treatment centre at the Landmark Convention Centre, Eti-Osa Local Government Area of 80 beds and 10 Intensive Care Units (ICU) on Wednesday.
Sanwo-Olu remarked that the Isolation and treatment centre emanated from Public Private Partnership (PPP) between the Lagos State Government and a nongovernmental organisation, Young Presidentsâ€™ Organisation (YPO), Lagos State Chapter.
The representative of YPO and Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, had earlier signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) before the governor commissioned the new health facility.
