An exchange on live television between two French doctors sparked outrage on social media after they suggested testing COVID-19 vaccines on Africans because “they do not have masks, treatment, nor intensive care.”

In the video, Jean-Paul Mira, the head of the intensive care department at the Cochin Hospital in Paris, proposes the idea of testing new coronavirus vaccines on African populations to Camille Locht, the research director at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM).

“If I can be provocative, shouldn’t we do this study in Africa where there are no masks, no treatment, no intensive care? A bit like we did in some studies on AIDS. We tried things on prostitutes because they are highly exposed and do not protect themselves,” said Mira.
