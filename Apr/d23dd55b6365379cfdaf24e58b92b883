“Kyari was a valued and respected interlocutor for the U.S. government and particularly for our leadership team in Abuja,” a statement by the US authorities in Nigeria revealed.
The US government described the late Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, as a dedicated public servant and respected interlocutor for the American government.
Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said in a statement Friday that the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy, wrote this in a condolence message to the President Muhammadu Buhari.
Nagy was said to have citied the “important role” played by Kyari in the repatriation of over $300m funds stolen by the late military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha.
“We appreciate working with him on many important matters, including the return to the Nigerian people of over $300 million in funds stolen by Sani Abacha,” Nagy said.
“He envisioned the funds going to three geographically disparate infrastructure projects as a way to unite Nigeria economically.”
According to him, the vision encapsulated by the late Chief of Staff was a reflection of his “tireless championing of a solid and prosperous future for Nigeria”.
“His dedication to this matter, to fighting corruption, and to countless other investments and policies for the future of Nigeria will leave a lasting impact on your country,” he added.
The US government pledged to stand with Nigeria in the struggle against the coronavirus pandemic.
Kyari was widely held by the critics of the APC government and Buhari as the strongest pillar of the three-man cabal at Aso Rock.
The PDP, First Lady Aisha Buhari, and many Nigerians believe the late CoS took over the leadership of Nigeria from his principal, mocking the APV government for surrendering power to an un-elected aide.
