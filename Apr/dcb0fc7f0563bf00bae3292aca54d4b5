President Muhammadu Buhari may have been caught in a seeming mix-up over the government responses to containing the spread and deaths from coronavirus in Nigeria. The president in a tweet on Sunday disclosed that his administration is adopting two approaches in combating coronavirus in the country. The president identified the two approaches as ensuing the security of lives of the people and easing the effect of coronavirus on businesses in Nigeria.
President Buhari made the revelation at a time world leaders are focusing on timely eradication of coronavirus, immediate palliatives for all citizens, then, post-corona virus policies for socio-economic recoveries.
The Presidency, however, in a tweet on Sunday, declared: “In Nigeria, we are taking a two-step approach. First, to protect the lives of our fellow Nigerians and residents living here and second, to preserve the livelihoods of workers and business owners.”
Protection of lives is a primary responsibility of government; but President Buhari considers it a policy of health crisis emergency. The spread of coronavirus has been on the rise, though, comparatively marginal, what is the President doing to reverse the trend and end the lockdown order?
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had at the update briefing, disclosed the detection of 13 new coronavirus cases. Then, additional 5 cases were detected on Monday.
The death rate has risen to 10 while over 80 patients have survived. That people are surviving is much better record the President should emphasise more and strengthen the medical facilities for more results; not incoherent media hype. Survival of coronavirus is more rational achievement than unnecessary self-praise.
