Iran appears to have lost hope of when the spread of coronavirus will end despite long period of lockdown. The Middle East country, therefore, opted for the risk of further risk to reopen the economy on Wednesday. The Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, on Wednesday noted that there is no end in sight to the coronavirus infection, thus, they are preparing to resume work.
President Hassan Rouhani, lamenting 80 new coronavirus deaths at Cabinet Meeting, declared: “Due to uncertainty about when this virus will end, we are preparing for work, activity and science.
“We have to follow all the medical instructions, but work and production are as essential as these precautions.”
The Ministry of Health earlier announced 80 new deaths from coronavirus, noting that death toll in the country has risen to 5,957.
spokesman of the Ministry, Kianoush Jahanpour, disclosed that more1,073 confirmed positive cases were recorded in Iran in the past 24 hours.
He had said in a news conference that 20,000 of the 93,657 people who contracted the illness since mid-February have been discharged from hospital.
While Iran is still contending with efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, several businesses were said to be permitted by the government to reopen since April 11 after shutting many businesses down in mid-March.
Iran has been struggling to contain the spread of coronavirus since reporting its first cases of two deaths in the country on February 19.
