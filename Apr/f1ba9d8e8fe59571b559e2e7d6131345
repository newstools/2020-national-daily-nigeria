The Biafra Nations Youth League (BNYL) has berated resident Muhammadu Buhari over what they considered discriminatory interventions on the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria, chiding the president for ignoring the southeast and south-south in cash transfers and other palliatives. The group scolded the president, ascribing him as a member of Covid419 team.
BNYL Deputy National Leader, and Head of Operations, BBS Media, Ebuta Takon Akor, stated that Coronavirus is a political pandemic in Nigeria. He noted that it has become a cool business for the federal government and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He was of the view they had anticipated that all Nigerians will test positive so opportunity will open for continuous looting of steal funds from crude oil revenue.
Akor chided the Nigerian president that the cash transfer directive and distribution of trucks of grains to the 36 states of the federation and the FCT is a scam, saying it is fraud. The BNYL Deputy National Leader noted that there has been no confirmation from the southeast and south-south that anybody has received alert from the Federal Government cash transfer. He accused President Buhari of playing with the survival of the people.
Ebuta Takon Akor further decried the abandoning of the Bakassi locked down by the Cameroonian government but excluded in Buhariâ€™s cash transfer palliative.
the BNYL leadership said the Bakassi people still pay tax to the Nigerian government as stipulated in the Greentree Agreement between Nigeria and Cameroon.
BNYL also noted that while the government claimed Imo benefited from the cash transfer, Imo people have been protesting their exclusion in the social media.
The group admonished the federal government to be transparent in the intervention measures, warning that the lockdown is affecting all Nigerians,
Essentially the poor who may die of hunger and starvation.
