China has denied allegations by the United States Intelligence sources that the the coronavirus might have originated in a medical laboratory rather than a food market in the city of Wuhan.
The virus which originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan has infected over 2 million across the globe and has killed 141,925 people, while about 535,380 have so far recovered.
Though more research was needed to clarify the origin of the virus, there was no evidence to suggest it was man-made, or that it originated in a laboratory, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.
“The World Health Organisation said there is no evidence that it was manufactured in a laboratory. Many renowned medical experts have also confirmed that the allegation that the virus leaked from a laboratory has no scientific basis,” the spokesman said.
The Chinese repudiation came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump was asked during a news conference to comment on media reports that U.S. intelligence was investigating whether the coronavirus came from a Chinese laboratory.
“I don’t want to say that. But I will tell you that we hear this story more and more,” Trump said.
The president added that his administration was investigating very closely what had happened.
Immediately after the news conference, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that China had failed to provide answers in this regard.
The U.S. broadcaster has been repeating this theory based on testimony from unnamed sources.
Experts believe the virus originated in an animal market in Wuhan, where the first infections also occurred.
