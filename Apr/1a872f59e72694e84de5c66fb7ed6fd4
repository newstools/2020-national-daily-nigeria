The DMW founder reveals he doesn’t have N30bn 
And says Chioma is doing fine

DMW Boss, Davido, has made some revelations as well as some bitter truths pertaining the current look of things in these coronavirus times.

In a Question and Answers session on Twitter, the singer revealed that most of his colleagues in the music industry might go broke in the nearest future if this pandemic continues.

While some of his Twitter followers voiced their displeasure, Davido went on to reiterate his point stating that there may not be any shows from now till 2021 given the nature of the outlined health and safety precautions prescribed in the fight against the trending pandemic, Coronavirus.

When asked by a fan on twitter to do giveaways, the US-born Nigerian artist also said he doesn’t have the funds for that. In his words, “No money for now, no show in sight abeg”. This reply of his was quickly followed by friendly reminder that he has 30 Billion Naira in his account to which Davido replied “Never had it”. Funny but this came as a surprise to many fans who genuinely thought the 30BG leader actually had that amount in his account as said in his chat topping song ‘If’ from 2017.

Davido also hinted that Chioma is doing well. And has still not shown symptoms of the coronavirus yet.
