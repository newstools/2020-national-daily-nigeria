The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq, has commiserated with the families that lost their loved ones in the sad and shocking fire incident that killed 14 people on Thursday at a camp for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Ngala Local Government Area, Borno State.
The Minister prayed for the souls of the deceased to rest in peace, wished the injured speedy recovery and promised to immediately deliver relief items to the surviving victims of the incidence.
She said: “I was touched by the loss of so many lives and property caused by the fire, and prayed that it should never happen again in the future.”
Sadiya Umar Farouq said that the fire would be investigated thoroughly as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari to determine its causes and proffer measures to avert future recurrence.
“President Muhammadu Buhari has directed an immediate provision of relief to the victims and the Ministry is working assiduously to do that,” the Minister said.
She said that the North East Development Commission (NEDC) and other agencies of the Ministry would act fast and deliver needed aid to the IDPs.
