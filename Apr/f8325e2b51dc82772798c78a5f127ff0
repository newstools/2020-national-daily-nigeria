The Chinese government has been sued by the State of Missouri in the United State of America (USA) on the ravaging corona virus pandemic. While this is the second lawsuit against China in the US, the Missouri is the first state in America to file legal suit against China on the Coronavirus pandemic.
The State of Missouri approached a federal court in US to compel China to accept responsibility for “deceit, concealment and inaction” on coronavirus outbreak, spread and associated dangers.
The State of Missouri top lawyer argued in the lawsuit at the federal court that Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians”.
The State of Missouri counsel protested that the Chinese government lied to countries of the world on the danger and contagious features of COVID-19, eliminated whistleblowers, and ignored stoppage of the spread of coronavirus.
The Chinese government was further accused of compounding the coronavirus through “hoarding” of masks, including personal protective equipment.
U.S. business interests were the first to file lawsuit against China in U.S. courts.
The United Kingdom had also raised alarm that China misinformed the world on the details of coronavirus outbreak which has tormented the world in the past three months. There are pressures on the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to file lawsuit against China in the International court in Hague for damages caused by coronavirus in the UK.
France, Japan and others are also holding China responsible for the coronavirus pandemic and the damages it has done so far across the world.
Several other countries who economies and health systems have been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic are also considering possible diplomatic actions against China when they have come of the dangers of coronavirus.
China has obviously incurred global hatred over the coronavirus pandemic.
