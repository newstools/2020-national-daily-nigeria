There was rising tension in Rivers State as a Sergeant shot a female police officer to death on Thursday. Several youths in the state were expressing anger over the incident which many attributed to the Task Force set up by Governor Nyesom Wike. The youths were so enraged that they ensured the picture of the dead female police officer went viral.
The female police officer was identified as Lovender Elekwachi, a sergeant, serving at Eneka Division, was posted to the Eneka roundabout on traffic duties. She was shot dead by Sergeant Bitrus Osaiah.
Rivers Police Command in a statement on Thursday indicated that Osaiah, assigned to Operations Department of the Command, has been disarmed and arrested.
The Police Command also said that Osaiah, seconded to the Rivers State Task Force on Decongestion, is undergoing ‘orderly room trial’.
The Rivers State Police Command also arrested two members of the Task Force who are undergoing interrogation.
The Command further impounded the Hilux vehicle assigned to the Task Force, while the corpse of the female Police Sergeant has been deposited in the mortuary.
The Commissioner of Police, CP Joseph G. Mukan, ordering investigations into the incident, appealed to residents of the state to remain calm, promising to ensure that justice prevails.
