As the lockdown continues, Celebs and Public Figures have had to rely on the social media and digital platforms to entertain fans and reach their devoted fan base.

Davido, the father of 3 and leader of the 30BG actually hosted Asa on his Instagram live as both of them sang each other’s song.

However guess who came under heated fire after the session?  Davido was bashed because of the way he sang Asa’s song.

Some were off keys connoting that Davido doesn’t have the golden voice to execute that and some claimed he was just lucky and fortunate to be a star after all.

One Twitter user went as far as tagging him a ‘disgrace called talent’.

See tweets below:

“Davido did a live battle with asa and it ended in tears, asa sent his career back to relegation, how will you battle with a legend when you don’t have talent, i am a davido fan but at this point davido should quit music and start amala business”

“I told y’all that Davido is the best vocalist in African y’all think I was joking…Davido performing one of asa popular song for her see how he is blending his voice like Michael Jackson and Chris Brown.”
