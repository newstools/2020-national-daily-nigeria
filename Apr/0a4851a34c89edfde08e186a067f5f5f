The tables have turned and it is now the turn of MI Abaga and Sarz on the beat. Reports had it that MI Abaga had made unruly comments while the former was on a live Instagram video with Blaqbonez.
Against all odds, despite the fact that MI Abaga had an intense beef with Vector tha Viper and responded appropriately, this time he only apologized.
Surprisingly, this has not degenerated into unbearable and disrespectful discussions although some have argued that Sarzâ€™ comments were a little too harsh and disrespectful.
This singular act of MI is commendable and if only other celebrities live above their name and learn to be apologetic when the need arises, then the world will be a better place for us all to live in.
