The transfer speculations of Philippe Coutinho has dominated the media lately as many are eager to know his latest destination considering how the Brazilian was sent on a season long loan to Bayern Munich after struggling to find form at Barcelona.
The 27-year old former Liverpool talisman has managed 21 goals for Barcelona since his record transfer of £142m in 2018 from the Reds.
Interestingly, the Brazil international has been able to enjoy some moments of brilliance at times for the German giants, scoring nine goals and providing eight assists to attract attention from Chelsea and a host of other Premier League sides.

Understandably, National Daily figured that Quique Setien – who replaced Ernesto Valverde in January may be aware of Coutinho’s quality irrespective of his post Liverpool predicaments was quick to open up on the Brazilian’s future with Barcelona.
“Coutinho? I like him very much,” he told Catalan radio station RAC 1.
“He is still a Barcelona player. You have to pay the clause or a transfer fee to Barca. I think he can be here at the beginning of next season.
“I don’t know if he wants to come back or go away again, I have to talk to him to ask him. He is a great player, no doubt about it.
Meanwhile, Setien’s position could imply that Coutinho may return to Barcelona, but Bayern Munich have the option to buy him at the end of the loan spell while Chelsea remain interested.
However, National Daily gathered that the Blues great Frank Leboeuf believes the reported price tag of £80m is far too high for the Brazilian’s services.
“You talk about Chelsea, ready to [pay] £80m,” he told ESPN earlier this month. “I think it’s too much for a player where you’re not sure he’s going to find the level he was, he used to be, at Liverpool and is not anymore.”
