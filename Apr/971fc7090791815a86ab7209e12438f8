United States citizens resident in New York can now hold their weddings over the internet.
Governor Andrew Cuomo made the announcement on Saturday.
The approval followed continued closure of the city’s marriage office due to the coronavirus lockdown.
“I am issuing an Executive Order allowing New Yorkers to obtain a marriage license remotely and allowing clerks to perform ceremonies via video conference,” Cuomo wrote.
According to reports, one of the engaged pair is usually required to attend the marriage bureau in person to obtain the marriage permit.
Meanwhile, restrictions on movement will remain effective until mid-May in New York.
The state is epicentre of the COVID lockdown.
More than 13,000 have died in from the disease in New York and nearly 40,000 in the whole of U.S.
