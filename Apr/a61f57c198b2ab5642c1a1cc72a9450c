Most critics of the All Progressives Congress (APC) government and the President Muhammadu Buhari administration from the South of Nigeria have urged northern opinion leaders to face realities and stop politicking with national issues. The southern critics emphasised that they do not hate President Muhammadu Buhari or the North but what they hate is bad leadership in the country. They reaffirmed their belief in good governance, transparent democracy, rule of law and national development.
The critics told northern opinion leaders that their propagation that the South hates the North is sheer illusion and deliberate plot to cause inter section disaffection in the glaring failure of government in the country.
They took to the social media platform to make a profound declaration.
“We don’t hate northerners, we hate only bad leaders.
“This man, Umar Musa Yar’Adua, is from the North and we love him. He did a lot of things before he died.
“Nigerians will never forget the tenure of Yar’Adua. Petrol was sold N65 per litre, diesel N112 per litre, bag of rice N3,500, bag of cement N750, bag of fertiliser N2,500, bag of flour N6,050,” they declared. The critics maintained: “who says we hate this man? We all like him. We need someone like Yar’Adua as President. This is the darkest period in Nigerian history.”
