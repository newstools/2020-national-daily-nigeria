Spain has reported its lowest daily death toll for coronavirus infections in five weeks.
According to The Associated Press, the health authorities said 288 people died from COVID-19 in 24 hours, taking the total to 23,190 since the start of the outbreak.
This is the first time the daily death toll has fallen below 300 since March 20, 2020.
The number of cases on a daily basis also dropped to 0.8 percent, down from over 20 percent in one month.
Fernando Simón, a Spanish health official, said the decrease in the number of fatalities was a significant development.
“As of tomorrow, our goal is no longer to reach the peak of the contagion curve, we are already there,” he said.
“Now we need to consolidate (our position) and think about how to safely move into the next phase of scaling down our restriction measures.”
Worldometer reports that Spain has recorded 223,759 COVID-19 cases and 95,708 persons have recovered.
For the first time since March 14, 2020, children were allowed to go out in Spain on Sunday.
“The new lockdown conditions allow Spain’s 6.3 million under-14s to leave their homes each day for a total of one hour between 9am and 9pm, but without going further than a kilometre,” BBC reported.
