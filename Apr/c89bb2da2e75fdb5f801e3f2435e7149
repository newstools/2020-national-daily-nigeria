The Edo State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Paul Ohonbamu, has the embattled former Chief of Staff of Governor Godwin Obaseki, Taiwo Akerele of attempting to blackmail the governor.
Recall that Akerele at the weekend cried out that his life is under threat after his residence at 1st Ugbor Road in Benin GRA was invaded by men of the Department of State Services on Sunday.
But the Edo State Director of the DSS, Sheikh Waziri, on Monday in a statement denied the allegation, noting that no operative of the service invaded Akerele’s residence on Sunday.
“I have verified and confirmed that the DSS Edo has not invaded the residence nor arrested anyone associated with the former CoS,” Waziri said.
The former CoS on Saturday resigned his appointment, while Obaseki had replaced him with Mr Osaze Ozamure. He disclosed that his life is under serious threat and he feels unsafe.
Responding, Ohonbamu dismissed Akerele’s allegation, noting that having accepted his resignation and appointed a new CoS, Obaseki had moved on and had nothing to benefit from attacking Akerele.
Ohonbamu said, “He is the least of our worry; no one is bothered about him; the governor has moved on. To say that the governor is after him is sheer falsehood and blackmail and it shows the kind of character we are dealing with.”
Meanwhile, the Directorate of State Service (DSS) in Edo has denied invading the residence or arresting anyone associated with Chief Taiwo Akerele, former Chief of Staff (CoS) to Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo.
