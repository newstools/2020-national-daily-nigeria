President Muhammadu Buhari last Friday lost his longtime friend and Chief of Staff Abba Kyari to the Covid-19 pandemic.
While the President is fighting hard to manage the pain of the exit of Kyari, the Presidency, on Tuesday, announced the death of one of President Muhammadu Buhari’s personal bodyguards, Warrant Officer Lawal Mato.
Mato, according to a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, died after three years of battling diabetes on Tuesday.
