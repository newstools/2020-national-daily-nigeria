Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has accused President Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government of politicising the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in the country.



The governor who stated this in a broadcast, said it was unfortunate that while the Federal Government gave Lagos State a grant of N10 billion to assist the state in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease, nothing was given to Rivers State as the nation’s oil and gas hub.
“One wonders why the federal government should single out a state out of 36 States to give support. Does it mean that support will come when a State has a record of over 50 infected persons before it gets support? No state should be seen as more important than any other state. This is a Federal Republic. No state is superior to others.
“Rivers State is entitled to support from the federal government. Every day, we are inundated with letters from the federal government to allow oil companies to fly in expatriates to drill Oil. Then we ask, what is the status of those coming from Lagos? Nobody has told us their status as regards coronavirus.
“If they come to come Rivers without us knowing their status, what will be implication assuming they have the virus,” he said.
