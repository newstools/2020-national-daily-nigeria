The Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammad Babandede, who recently tested positive to COVID-19, has expressed gratitude to Allah for the opportunity to be sick.
Babandele who stated this in a video he shared on Wednesday night, said that Allah allowing him to be infected with the dreaded virus had “given him an opportunity to be humble.”
He said, “Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I will like to thank all my friends, loved ones, officers and men, Muslims and Christians in Nigeria and abroad for the enormous prayers for my quick recovery,” he said in the video shared on the NIS Twitter handle.
“I am very grateful for your prayers. In reality, your prayers are helping me recover very quickly.
“Allah knows better but I thank Allah for giving me the opportunity to be sick because it gives me the opportunity to humble myself, to also know that I am loved by such a large number of people.
“Today, the 1st of April, I am sending this short video to you to tell you I’m doing well and recovering gradually.”
He called on Nigerians to ensure they wash their hands and maintain social distance.
“This disease is real. Continue to pray that Nigeria does not head towards any disaster. The numbers are still small but continue to pray that it does not grow,” he added.
Babandede confirmed on Sunday, March 29, that he was COVID-19 positive.
