There was mild drama at the National Assembly when lawmakers resumed on Tuesday but obstructed Journalists from entering the National Assembly chambers for coverage of the proceedings in the two chambers of the federal legislature. Reasons were not given for the action; security operatives were instructed to enforce restriction of movement and perhaps, crowd control to limit the number of persons allowed into the National Assembly complex.
After about two hours of waiting, a list of accredited journalists to be granted access into the Assembly chambers released and this was presented to journalists waiting at the entrance gate. Others had to go back without coverage of the Tuesday plenary of the two chambers of the federal legislature. The restriction was extended to legislative aides of the lawmakers including directors in the National Assembly; they were turned back by the police who barricaded the entrance to the Assembly complex.
