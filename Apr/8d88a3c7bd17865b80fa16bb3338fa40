The Oro cultural group has joined the various vigilante groups to secure border communities from armed robbers in Lagos. The troubled communities currentlyÂ  under siege of armed robbers during the coronavirus lockdown imposed by President Muhammadu Buhari in the past two weeks, has received minimal intervention of the Police.

Thus, residents of the border communities have organised themselves into groups keeping vigil at night in their neighbourhood waiting for the robbers who rob homes in groups of 50 members and above.

The youths, men, women, including girls, get armed with whatever arm is at their disposal, burn tyres, waiting for the enemies of the society.

Some youths have taken up the challenge to secure the communities. They are not seeing themselves different from the gang robbers identified to be in their age brackets. They mobilise themselves in large groups of 40, 50 abd above moving from one street to the other, to protect their neighbourhood.

The Oro cultural group know to operate at night when people are indoors, has also taken to the streets, moving from one spot to the other in their traditional practice. The Oro group also identifies with youths on the streets during procession.
