The 2019/20 season may be cancelled if the La Liga clubs are not able to return to action by June 27.
Although the teams have agreed that they will do what it takes to finish the league, the government will still need to give the green light for football to return.
If the league can’t return by June 27, it means that the situation in the country has not improved and football should be put aside.
“If at that point the whole country has not returned to normal activity, football will be what matters least and the ruin will be almost total,” club presidents explained.
Some teams have already ruled out returning to action in later April or early May.
Meanwhile, clubs are willing to compress the remainder of the season into four to five weeks, playing three matchdays per week.
Although LaLiga teams are still confident that they will be able to finish the season, they believe that this could happen with games behind closed doors.
Playing with fans is an unnecessary risk and there will be upturns,” added another club president.
“It does not seem sensible, although anyone who works in a store and is touching money or merchandise will be in the same situation.”
There is a certain optimism, which is not scientifically confirmed, that summer heat may limit the spread of the Coronavirus and so the season could be extended into July or even early August.
However, following the cancellation of the Wimbledon tennis tournament, which was set to take place in June, the clubs have expressed their pessimism on whether LaLiga can return soon.
