David Adeleke, aka Davido, just got his heart stolen by a very beautiful painting of himself and family.
The artwork is assumed to be the work of a street painter whose’s life is about to change.
As Davido just tweeted some minutes ago that his fans should help get the paint (and the painter).
The beautiful art has Davido kissing Chioma flanked by Davido’s three kids.
The painter must have guessed the look of Davido’s newborn. And a tweet on the Davido’s thread captured the artist’s brilliance.
He tweeted, “He had to design an imaginary baby face of Davido with a dimple and put it on the child’s face  aww
️️ [IMO]”.
You may recall that Davido’s girlfriend and mother of only son named Ifeanyi Adeleke had tested positive for coronavirus.
Chioma is said to be asymptomatic (not shwoing any signs of the virus) and coping well.
