Health authorities in Lagos have confirmed that Covid-19 is not spreading as fast as it is in Europe and Asia, and it will never be thanks largely to the state’s proactive steps.
According to Lagos Commissioner for Health Akin Abayomi, Lagos currently has capacity to test for 150 cases per day in the three centres, and the state is using the Molecular Biological Test, which is 100 percent accurate to conduct test on suspected cases.
There are now 81 confirmed cases in Lagos, as the NCDC announced.
But Abayomi said only 66 of the cases were confirmed in Lagos while 15 were brought in from off the coast of Lagos.
“So, out of the 66 cases in Lagos State, eight have been discharged and nobody has died. Nobody in our ward looking like they are going to die,” he told newsmen in Lagos on Tuesday.
Half of these patients in the isolation ward, he noted, are experiencing mild illness while the remaining half experience moderate illness.
