A corps member has tested positive to Covid-19 in Ondo, making t the third confirmed case in the southwestern state.
The latest victim is a medical doctor having his primary assignment at the 32 Artillery Brigade, Owena Cantonment.
He contracted the disease from the first index case, a military officer, from the cantonment.
Confirming the development in a statement Tuesday, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, said Governor Rotimi Akeredolu will address the people of the state on further details in respect of this case and provide deeper insights.
Akeredolu has been denying the case is a serving corps member
“Infected person is not a current National Youth Service Corps – NYSC corps member as stated online. The individual was an ex corps member that served in the hospital where the index case was identified and was retained,’ he tweeted.
“As it is typical for all cases, all protocols for contact tracing have been activated with those closest to the new case kept in isolation for observation.”
