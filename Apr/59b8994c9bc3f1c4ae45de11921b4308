A COVID-19 patient receiving treatment at the Infectious Disease Control Centre, Down Quarters, Kaduna, was on Thursday captured after trying to escape from the isolation centre.
Narrating the development, Corps Assistant Joshua Philip who was posted to centre to provide security services in and on the isolation centre, said the patient tried to leave the centre without authorization.
â€œThe suspected COVlD-19 patient tried to leave the Center for morning prayers without the permission of doctors. A confrontation ensued between our personnel and the patient who forcefully picked the keys of the gate of the Center and tried to open the gate to escape.
The Covid 19 index is said to have engaged the Civil Defence Officer Joshua Philip in serious fracas after he stopped him from leaving his quarantine ward at the isolation center, this exposed the officer to the patient of the Covid 19.
The keys were disinfected, despite that, the doctor gave the personnel some drugs; he was instructed to self-Isolation for two weeks and to call the Center if he develops any symptoms.
The Corps has since strengthened its security measures in the internal isolation centre.
