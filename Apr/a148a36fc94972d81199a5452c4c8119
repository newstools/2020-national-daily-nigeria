Following the announcement by the NCDC of two new cases of Covid-19 in Edo, the state government too has confirmed the latest development.
The south-south state now boasts a total of 11 confirmed cases.
And the state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr Patrick Okundia, said the fight against coronavirus disease has been on in the state.
“Our people have been told, but the message we are getting is that our people are not taking these messages seriously. This is a serious business.
“As we are receiving new cases every day, the state has been prepared in fighting this disease by providing different isolation centers across the state,”he said April 6.
“We have four isolation centers in the state. One is at the Central Hospital Auchi, another one is at Irrua Specialist Hospital, we have one at University of Benin Teaching Hospital and one at Stella Obansajo Hospital.
“The state has also provided a holding center at the Stella Obansajo Hospital where suspected cases of coronavirus who are awaiting results are going to be kept.
“Anybody with symptoms should go straight to Stella Obansajo Hospital, doctors and nurses have been trained to attend to such people,” NAN quoted him as saying.
He asked the citizens to work together with the state government in fighting the pandemic.
