Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have been argued as the best football stars to embrace the game especially in recent time.
This has left football fans divided on who is a better player between the Argentine captain and his Portuguese counterpart.
Amazingly, one of the world’s best football managers believes that neither the Barcelona talisman nor the Juventus hitman passes as the best player to embrace the beautiful game of football as many widely believe National Daily can confirm.
For the current Tottenham manager, Ronaldo Nazario beats both his compatriot and the Argentine legend to the position of the best footballer.
Interestingly, before Ronaldo and Messi graced the globe with their footballing prowess, Ronaldo Nazario ruled the roost.
Though the Brazilian won the World Cup twice, and collected two Ballon d’Or trophies during a glittering career playing for both Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the Champions League evaded him.
Sadly for Ronaldo Nazario, injuries hampered what could have been an even more successful career and he didn’t enjoy quite as long out on the field as Messi or his namesake.
Thankfully, Mourinho who is self-styled the “Special One” got a brief look at the Brazilian in person when he worked under legendary boss Bobby Robson as an interpreter at Barcelona, and it appears that the then teenager was able to leave a serious impression on the Portuguese.
Mourinho speaking to LiveScore held that: “Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. Cristiaano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers, they have remained at the top every day for 15 years.
“However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo [Nazario]. When he was at Barcelona with Bobby Robson, I realised that he was the best player I’d ever seen take to the field.
“Injuries killed a career that could have been even more incredible, but the talent that that 19-year-old boy had was something incredible.”
