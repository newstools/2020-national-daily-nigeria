Dear Brymo,
You are nobody’s mate.
Your newly dropped music album, Yellow, is either not a Nigerian or a better Nigerian.
It’s a pure kiss from fresh lips.
You just made a statement in a language only quality and originality can understand. This new album is everything called True Standard Music.
If Burna Boy wants to be the African Giant, Brymo has decided to be a Music Professor. No song by any Nigerian, since the new era, has ever been this original.
And if anyone values volumes of fresh sensible content over diluted and undiluted melodeus jargons, then I see such person(s) stealing a crown for you.
“Smart monkey dont monkey around with another monkey’s banana”
There, one of those pure lines you used to uplift art and tell your stories. You told a lot of stories and leave listeners challenged by your very powerful thoughts.
It’s been a long time a Nigerian music has been this enjoyable and sensible.
Tracks like Black Man Black Woman opens and expands our thoughts. It challenges our inspirations in a unique way.
“If na the days of our fore fore fathers the way we dey live them go call us messiahs..”
There, one of the many lines that you drop with a very awesome irresistible vocals. You just raised the bar. For a long time Nigeria’s alternative music scene has really lacked mentorship. I do see this album ably and aptly filling that gap.
As a Nigerian this is one album of pride. It’s an item to use as a bragging tool. Something to tender on the table of banters where and when other peeps from other nations dare to say Nigerians don’t compose music.
Yeah, one can hardly get any current Nigerian artiste singing sense these days. You graduated above all them Wizzy, Tuface, Davido, Burna Boy with this great work. And as a Wizzy and Tuface fan, that’s hard truth.
This is grammy standard.
Your Yellow spotter,
Ediale

PS: This is how music should sound. Classic!
