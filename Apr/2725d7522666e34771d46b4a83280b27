Schools will not reopen yet in Nigeria, and the federal government is not in a hurry to fix a date.
Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba stated this while responding to questions during the daily briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 pandemic.
“The president actually addressed the issue of the opening of the economy gradually. Until that is done, we can’t foresee or immediately tell you when all the schools will be reopened,” Nwajiuba said.
“It will not be proper for us to simply give you a date. It has to be in tandem with these opening terms. We don’t want to put our children at risk. None of these schools can function on their own without the society.”
About the West African Examinations Council reportedly cancelled, the minister said the exam will come up when it is safe.
Questions about school resumptions have been tugging at parents since President Muhammadu Buhari announced gradual re-opening of Lagos, Ogun, ad Abuja locked down a month ago.
