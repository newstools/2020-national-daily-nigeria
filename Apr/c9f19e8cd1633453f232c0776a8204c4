Funke Akindele, a Nollywood superstar and NCDC ambassador, organised a house party in her Lekki home where other celebs junketed and made a show of it even as the rest of the state lies low in lockdown.
While criticisms rain down from many social media users who saw the video posted, celebrating her husband’s birthday, the Nigerian police and other enforcement authorities have yet to react to the law breaking.
The Lagos Infection Diseases Regulations 2020 (the Regulations) punishes offenders with a jail term of one month or N100,000 fine or both for persons found guilty of hosting gatherings or flouting the lockdown order.
In the video posted on social media by her husband, Abdulrasheed Bello aka JJC Skillz, are Naira Marley and other showbiz hotshots.
“Na here we dey, those of us wey get mind (sic). This is the best estate to be stuck in during the lockdown. It is my birthday,” said JJC Skillz among his guests singing ‘Ma fo’, a 2019 song by Naira Marley.
Akindele has appeared in adverts urging Nigerians to observe social distancing and hygiene.
