The Commander of the Special Military Task Force (STF), mandated to restore peace in Plateau State, some parts of Bauchi and Southern Kaduna, Maj. Gen. Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, has promised to prevent further attacks by unknown gunmen in the State.
Gen. Okonkwo said the days of hiding under ethnicity to execute incessant killings is also over, adding that his command will not tolerate criminal elements in whatever guise.
The Army boss made this known on Friday, during an operational visit to the troubled communities of Kpashio and Rogochongo villages in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau.
Frowning at the attacks that has hitherto bedeviled the Irigwe community in Bassa, Okonkwo warned trouble shooters to stay off the district.
“We have assured the people of our readiness to prevent further attacks. This assurance also extends to those in various locations under our mandate. We have began coordinated operations and constant patrols”, he said.
Responding, a community leader, Leo Dillon, said the presence of the troops has further build public confidence in the area, adding that the community will improve in its vigilance and work with security agencies for the sustenance of peace.
