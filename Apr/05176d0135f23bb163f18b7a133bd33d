The family of a regional manager who died in Kano following Covid-19 complications is blaming the NCDC for the death of the breadwinner, and neglect of his family members who might have been infected.
According to reports, the manager fell sick on Friday, coughing, gasping, and hot with fever, and was initially admitted in a private hospital where he was put on oxygen.
The hospital pulled the plug because there was no improvement, and then referred him to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital.
His mother-in-law, Hajiya Salma Ahmed, in a viral audio, recounted how efforts they made to contact the National Centre for Disease Control failed.
According to her, they finally got to “Abuja NCDC” and were assured that officials in Kano would visit the patient to take his samples.
“No one visited up till my son-in-law died in agony,” she said.
She expressed worries her daughter and other family members might have contacted the disease.
Kano NCDC lab was shuttered following infection of health workers early in the week. Samples are now taken to Abuja for analysis.
The state is currently the epicentre of the pandemic in northern Nigeria, have 147 confirmed cases.
