The Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections, Peter Obi, on Wednesday, expressed surprising support for President Muhammadu Buhari on the extension of the lockdown order in the battle to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country.
Obi on Channels Television programme, Sunrise Daily on Wednesday monitored from Lagos, emphasized that the extension of the lockdown order by President Buhari was necessary and important because Nigeria does not have the facilities to handle the pandemic if it escalates. He maintained, in agreement with President Buhari, that containing the spread of coronavirus is the best option for the country now.
“.. the extension of two weeks is necessary and important. It is necessary and important because we don’t have the resources to fight the pandemic if it escalates and spreads.
“The only thing we have now is containment. But in doing so, it is critical we look at ways we can manage this process effectively.”
Obi advocated that the Federal Government should establish more testing centres that will empower the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to detect more coronavirus cases in the country.
Obi further remarked: “Right now, our testing process is very low compared to our pairs even in Africa.”
Obi expressed dismay over the persistence of hunger in Nigeria; he counseled President Buhari to hasten the administration of palliatives to minimize the hardship of the stay-at-home order.
