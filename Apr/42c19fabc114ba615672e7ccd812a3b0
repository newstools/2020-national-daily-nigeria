Popular Musician Korede Bello has caused an uproar on Twitter following his interference in the savage reply from Burna Boy to Reekado banks.

It all started when a fan asked Burna Boy to go toe to toe with any other musician in what the fan called “hit battle” and Burna Boy accepted, immediately he accepted Reekado Banks also volunteered to engage him in a battle..

After Reekado banks accepted the battle, Burna Boy roasted him with a Savage reply, telling him he wasn’t a worthy challenger.

Having seen that his Former label mate under the Mavin Records  had been savaged or insulted, Korede just threw a slight question at Burna Boy. He asked if Burna  Boy had any insecurities.

Couple of hours after he interfered in the conversation, fans of Burna Boy started attacking the young talented musician with savage comments as well.

Amidst the savage comments, one comment from a troll made my day to be filled with laughter, the troll warned Korede Bello that when Burna was releasing hits he didn’t have beards”.
