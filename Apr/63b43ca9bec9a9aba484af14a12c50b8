The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo SAN, on Thursday subtly counseled President Muhammadu Buhari on the consequences of coronavirus pandemic and need for preparations for the social and economic effects of the pandemic after the crisis, essentially, its threats of low economic activities, hunger, poverty and depression.  He also cautioned against government intolerance or clampdown on populist opinions about the government during this time of health crisis.
Keyamo taking to the social media platform advocated that people should allowed to express their opinions on the ravaging coronavirus infection ravaging the country.
The Minister acknowledged that the “preponderance of opinions in countries around the world is that majority of citizens are blaming their governments for not doing enough to curb COVID-19.” He declared: “We must be tolerant and allow people vent their opinions. It is a sign of the times. The grass is always greener on the other side.”
Keyamo subsequently, alerted: “The challenge that’ll soon face governments around the world is how to keep their citizens safe from COVID-19 by imposing inactivity and at the same time how to keep them safe from poverty, hunger and depression as a result of the inactivity. It’s a decision between the rock and a hard place.”
The Minister has sent strong post-coronavirus challenges to federal government of Nigeria on decision making and implementation in the post-coronavirus era. Reference that “it is a decision between the rock and a hard a place,” is not far from the activities in the Aso Rock or the Presidential Villa. This makes the message more specific.
