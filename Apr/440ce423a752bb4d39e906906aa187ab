Former Super Eagles Captain and current assistant coach of Nigeria, Joseph Yobo has remarked that the senior national team of Nigeria still does not have a top-rated playmaker since Jay Jay Okocha bowed out of the team 14 years ago,National Daily learnt.
The ex-Everton defence said that there is no proper attacking midfielder in Super Eagles .
Yobo explained that since Jay Jay and Wilson Oruma left in the early 2000s National team hasnt brought in a very good attacking midfielder.
He added that  X-raying the N0. 10 options the Super Eagles have had in recent times, Yobo said Mikel did a great job while Iwobi has been doing fine but more is still left to be desired.
Assistant Coach  Super Eagles said  Mikel did wonderfully well, but he is not a proper no. 10. He started as an attacking midfielder and then he moved back to defensive midfield”.
Assessing Alex Iwobi as a no. 10, Yobo said “I think Iwobi can do a job there, he has done well in that role, I saw him during the AFCON last year but he still looks new in that position”.
Yobo added that Iwobi on his day can do a whole lot of magic, he is unpredictable but he is still inconsistent, that is because he is new to the position. I really do believe in him.
The former Fenerbache player said Nigeria is blessed with abundant talent but the country must look deep and unearth another gem to fill the huge gap in that area.
The 39-year old made 101 appearances for the Super Eagles before bowing out in 2015. He represented Nigeria at three FIFA World Cup tourneys in 2002, 2010 and 2014, as well as helping the nation win the African Cup of Nations in 2013.
Yobo concluded that although Nigeria has used players who have done really well in the no. 10 role but there is need to develop a new no. 10.
