PDP’s vice presidential candidate in the 2019 general election, Peter Obi, has supported President Muhammadu Buhari’s move to lock down the entire country as Covid-19 pandemic covers 16 states of the federation.

The former Anambra governor also hammered governors that relaxed the lockdown in their states for religious purposes, especially the Easter celebration.

“Lock up Nigeria and we will solve our problems from within,” he said during an interview on Arise TV on Friday.

“It is wrong to relax lockdown because of people going to church. Faith is a thing of the mind. You can worship without going to church.”







He noted that COVID-19 is spreading quickly in Nigeria and there are not enough resources to manage it.
“We have a crisis that we don’t have the resources to manage. The greatest country in the world is America. They are on their knees now health-wise and economically.
He urged those in government not to watch things degenerate to that level because Nigeria cannot manage it.
Buhari locked down Lagos, Ogun, and FCT 11 days ago, and chances are high he might extend it in four day’s time when the federal government will review the situation.
Nigerian has recorded 288 infections, and 7  deaths so far.
