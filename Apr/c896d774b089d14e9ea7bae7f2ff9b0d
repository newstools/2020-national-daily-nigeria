The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday secured interim forfeiture of a three-bedroom bungalow and a Honda C50 motorcycle with number plate, GBK 283 US, traced to Emmanuel Agana James who is being investigated by the EFCC for fraud.
The order was granted by Justice Sampson Itodo of a Benue State High Court, Makurdi following an ex-parte application by the Makurdi Zonal Office of the EFCC.
The Commission’s counsel, G. G. Chia-Yakua, had in the application, dated March 31, 2020, prayed the Court for an Interim Order, forfeiting to the Federal Government the three-bedroom uncompleted bungalow situated on a plot of land with an area measuring 470.421m2 and a scale of 1:500 at plot 3090 Genabe Mega Layout Phase (II), Apir, Makurdi.
Also included in the forfeiture order was a Honda (Motorcycle) (Blue Color) C50 with Registration No. GBK 283 US, Engine No. C50E-0075597 and Chasis No. C50-0075192. They were acquired in the name of James.
Moving the application, Chia-Yakua told the Court that the property was suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities, derived from funds allegedly diverted by James from the sales of foodstuff of Rikadawa Foods Nigeria Ltd.
He further argued that there was need to preserve the properties in question as “any disposal, conveyance, mortgage, lease, sale or alienation of the said property may render any subsequent final forfeiture order by the Court nugatory”.
Granting the interim order, Justice Itodo further directed “the publication of a notice in the national newspaper,  inviting all person(s) or corporate entities who may have interest in the said properties to show cause within 14 days from the date of publication why it should not be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria.”
