This was disclosed by the Commander, OPSH, Major General Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, when he paid a courtesy visit to the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 3 Division, Major General Nuhu Angbazo, at the Headquarters, Maxwell Khobe Cantonment Rukuba, Jos.
Okonkwo said the collaboration has become imperative as Plateau need to reclaim its glory as the State of peace and tourism.
“I called for support and cooperation of the Division aimed at ensuring lasting peace to Plateau”, the OPSH boss said.
Responding, Gen. Angbazo said the taskforce and the 3 Division have always enjoyed close synergy in tackling insecurity and criminality, pledging that the collaboration will continue to soar higher.
“The 3 Division will continue to work closely with the OPSH in the bid to bring total peace to Plateau State and across its joint operational areas”. Angbazo said.
