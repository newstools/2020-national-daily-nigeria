5G is 10,000 times the strength of 4G. It uses same frequency as a military weapon; it rips DNA structures of living organisms.
Identifiable health hazards or symptoms of 5G include:

Shortness of breath

2. Passing out
3. Cold and flu symptoms
4. Fever
5. Increase in cancer risk
6. Foggy thinking
7. Eye pain
8. Nightmares
9. Nausea
10. Vomiting
11. Diarrhea
12. Headache
13. Dizziness
14.  Disorientation
15. Weakness
16. Fatigue
17. Hair loss
18. Vomiting blood, stooling and internal bleeding
19. Infections
20. Low blood pressure.
Invariably, there is high suspicion that the coronavirus may be a disguise for China to install 5G in countries of the world.
