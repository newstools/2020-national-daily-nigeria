Nigerian singer, Teni is super ecstatic about her elder sister’s certification from The Grammys.

Niniola was one of the composers of the track “Find Your Way Back” off Beyonce’s “The Gift” album which contains elements of her hit single “Maradona”. The album earned a Grammy nomination for the Best Pop vocal album and the recording Academy sent in a certificate of participation to Niniola.

A very proud Teni took to her Instagram page to congratulate her sister and said there would be an online after-party to celebrate the amazing achievement soon.

She wrote: Congratulations to my sister @officialniniola on your Grammy award!! So so proud of you! Congrats to the entire APATA FAMILY ON THE WIN OF OUR DAUGHTERS GRAMMY!!!!! ONLINE PARTY COMING SOON!!!!!
