Lagos State government is trailing Madagascar in finding African therapy to coronavirus. Madagascar early this week unveiled Covid-Organics, herbal components for prevention and remedy of coronavirus.
Lagos State government has indicated that traditional medicine could become an option to explore in the fight against coronavirus.
The Commissioner for Health in Lagos State, Professor Akin Abayomi, on Channel Television morning programme – SUNRISE DAULY – on Saturday, monitored from Lagos, disclosed that the state government has come to the point of conducting research on traditional medicine for the treatment of coronavirus.
The Commissioner maintained that the state government is pressing very hard to explore traditional medication in the fight against coronavirus.
the commissioner said.
The commissioner highlighted: “Of course, you can support yourself with a good diet, good food and lots of natural therapies; that’s one thing that we are pushing very hard in Lagos – our traditional medicine.
“We have a traditional medicine board; a traditional medicine research committee, and I believe that there are several natural therapies that we need to investigate.
“We have a whole ecosystem of plants and herbs, if we haven’t destroyed them all by our wanton deforestation, we would have access to a lot of therapies from the environment that we could test out.
“Destroying the ecosystem is what’s causing these zoonotic events and its depriving us of our natural heritage to find traditional solutions to these problems.”
The commissioner added that adequate sleep can boost the immune system.
“One of the best ways to raise your immune system is sleep. As the body rests, it allows the immunity to do its job.
“If you get sick with the flu or with Coronavirus, the best thing is to stay in bed and get lot of rest and allow your body’s energy to be consumed by the immune system which is trying to do the curing,” the commissioner said.
