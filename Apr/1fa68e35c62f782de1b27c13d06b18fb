A Civil Rights Advocacy group-: HUMAN RIGHTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (HURIWA) has carpeted the Lagos State Government for the arraignment  of the General Overseer of Resurrection Praise Ministries for Africa, alias Jehovah Sharp Sharp, Archbishop Samson Benjamin, for reportedly violating its lockdown order to lead protesters to the Chinese Embassy in Lagos to demonstrate the maltreatment of Africans in China.
HURIWA in a statement by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, and the National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, argued that the arraignment of the Nigerian protesters for standing up to reject the dehumanization of their fellow Africans by the government and the people of China shows that the Nigeria Police has become subservient to foreign interests as against aligning to protect the fundamental human rights of Nigerians everywhere in the World.
“HURIWA expected that the Nigeria Police rather than arrest the patriotic Nigerians should have ensured that the demonstrators respected social distancing rules even as they agitate for the redress of the gross violations of the human rights of Nigerians in China. The impression created by the Lagos police command in arresting and prosecuting the leader of the protesting Nigerians is that the policing institution is now the lapdog of foreign powers like China only because CHINA seems to have financially enticed African leaders with dubious loans that has made them to become stooges of the Chinese government.
“We call on the Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice and Governor Babajide SanwaOlu to withdraw all the charges against the protesters and to end this state sponsored suppression of the human rights provisions.  The Social distancing Rules must not be used as a subterfuge to advance the neocolonialism of the Chinese government in Nigeria”, HURIWA declared.
