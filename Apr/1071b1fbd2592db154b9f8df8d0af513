Germany has approved clinical trials of multiple vaccines developed by German biotech company, BioNTech, for treatment of coronavirus. Scientists were said to be monitoring the effectiveness of the vaccines in generating immunity against coronavirus. The clinical trial will be starting with 200 participants of 18 to 55 years age bracket.
Statistics from Johns Hopkins University shows that coronavirus has killed over 177,000 people and infected 2.5 million across the world. This was identified to have given impetus to the race to develop vaccines that can contain the spread of coronavirus and the associated deaths across the world.
About 86 teams were identified to be engaged on research and study for coronavirus vaccines across the world.
