Nigerian International and Aris of Greece hitman Brown Ideye, has revealed reasons why he failed to appear at the  2014 FIFA World Cup.
Ideye explained that during my move from Dynamo Kiev to West Brom, he didn’t want me to make that move.
I had a better deal fo me. I told him that the only place I was looking at is the Premiership. This was before the 35-man list for the World Cup came out. We started having arguments, I told him if you can’t do this for me I will find another person”
Its was gathered by National Daily through George Essien who phoned Ideye,he   revealed that he faulted his former agent for his omission from the World Cup list.
Bobby as he is fondly called formed a blockbuster partnership with Emmanuel Emenike to win the 2013 AFCON title and scored 10 goals in 37 games for Dyanmo Kiev in the 2013/2014 season, whilst pushing for a move to the English Premier league.
According to him, it all went sore after he ended their relationship.
” I told him we are done, that’s how I cut off from him and I found someone who succeeded to get the move to West Brom. Two Weeks after, the list came out and my name wasn’t included. I wasn’t surprised as I was hearing rumours that I wasn’t included because I sacked my agent. A reliable source, someone very close to both of us told me of his intentions to punish me for ending his services to me”.
Ideye, 31, later played at the FIFA Confederation Cup and on 18 July 2013, joined West Brom for 10 million pounds; a club record fee then. He later returned to National team football and last featured in the 2016 World Cup qualifiers, against Zambia in Ndola.
