”Wizkid once came to perform in my school, picked out 3 girls from the crowd to dance on stage. After dancing, he (presumably) asked them to follow him to his hotel for the night. One of the girls walked into the crowd, picked her handbag from her boyfriend and disappeared backstage

“That experienced f*cked me up in so many ways. It was a shocker for everyone, people were screaming, taunting the guy and all. But it messed up my mind. Not sure I slept that night —got back late anyways. Men are scum

“And for those asking… It happened in OAU. I remember 3 girls, some are saying they were 4. But that story was heart wrenching. I almost cried for that Nigga. Experiences like that makes success in life your only option. Never end up on the wrong side of the equation..”
