In spite of all the tantrums and nitpicking, Nigerians eventually had to welcome a team of Chinese medical experts who just flew in aboard Air Peace to help Nigeria fight Covid-19 pandemic.
The 15-man team arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja around 5  pm Wednesday.
The federal government initially said it was expecting 18 experts.
On hand to welcome them were China’s ambassador to Nigeria, Dr Zhou Pingjian and Executive Director, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, Mr Jacques Liao.
Others were senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Health amongst others.
Beides Nigerian kicking against the Chinese intervention in Africa, the US, whose casualty figure has overtaken Italy and Spain, is also at diplomatic war with the People’s Republic.
But WHO has encouraged the US and China to put their differences aside and work together, since China has been able to tide over the storm of the pandemic that first broke out of Wuhan last December.
