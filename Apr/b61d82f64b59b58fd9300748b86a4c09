Global Citizen is a movement of engaged citizens who are using their collective voice to end extreme poverty by 2030. On their platform, Global Citizens learn about the systemic causes of extreme poverty, take action on those issues, and earn rewards for their actions — as part of a global community committed to lasting change.

Their mission is to build a movement of 100M action-taking Global Citizens to help achieve the vision of ending extreme poverty by 2030. But this time, they chose to raise awareness on the deadly COVID-19 and have decided to leverage on the fame and integrity of Nigeria’s very own, Burna Boy.

This is what we expect and nothing below this standard. At all times, we expect that they be Global citizens, preaching against all sorts of societal ills and flaws.
