Of the three governors that came down with covi-17 few days ago, two–Govs. Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Bala Mohammed (Bauchi)–he got an all-clear.
The third, Kaduna Gov. Nasir El-Rufai, 60, however, remains quarantined
On Monday Makinde, 52, tested negative, four days after his infection, and April 9, Mohammed was equally declared virus-free, after about two weeks in isolation.
While Mohammed, 61, thanked those who supported him with prayers during the intervening period, Makinde added he took black seed oil and worked his leg muscles on a treadmill to recover.
But since El-Rufai tweeted about his infection about the tme Mohammed also tested positive, nothing has been heard about the only APC governor of the three state CEOs infected so far.
His wife however asked Nigerians to pray along for her husband.
