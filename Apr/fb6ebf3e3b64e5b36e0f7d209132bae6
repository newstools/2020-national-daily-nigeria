A Kano commissioner got the boot Saturday for celebrating the death of President Muhammadu Buhari’s CoS Abba Kyari who died from Covid-19 complications on Friday.
Gov. Umar Gnaduje ordered the sack of his Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Mu’azu Magaji, and the action was announced by the government Director-General, Media and Communications, Salihu Yakasai.
Yakasai said the dismissal of Magaji over his “unguarded utterances” was with immediate effect.
“H.E @GovUmarGanduje has relieved the appointment of the commissioner of Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Mu’azu Magaji with immediate effect following his unguarded utterances against the person of the late Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari,” Yakassai tweeted on Saturday.
Magaji had posted on his Facebook page a statement describing Kyari’s death as freedom for Nigeria.
“Win win… Nigeria is free and Abba kyari ya mutu a cikin annoba… Mutuwar shahada in Har da Imani mutum ya cika,” he wrote.
In English, Magaji said, “Win win… Nigeria is free and Abba Kyari has died in the epidemic… the death of a martyr… if he is a believer, the person is complete.”
He later reinforced that by explaining how powerful the office of the CoS has been, advocating for a re-organisation.
“For the good of Nigeria and Mr President… The CoS office should be split… A PPS (principal private secretary) and a humble manager of his office as CoS… It is currently too powerful for a non-elected official.”
The former commissioner insisted there was nothing personal about his response.
