LMC Chairman,  Shehu Dikko has insisted that NNL clubs will not be promoted with only five league matches played, saying that all issues in the league will be sorted out immediately normalcy returns to football world over.
The NFF Second Vice President who was answering questions in an Online program organized by the FCT Football Update Platform, said the NFF was meeting with the management of  the NNL alongside with the Minister to find a way out of the impasse that evolved the second tier League which is assumed to be the most important League in the country.
Quoting his words, Dikko said “We all know that the LMC has always been concerned  as the apex league to ensure the welfare and sustainability of the leagues below the pyramid, NNL inclusive. We use to offer our support, both financially and regulatory when we can to ensure they keep working. So just before the suspension of football activities we were all locked in serious conversation led by NFF President and hugely supported by the Minister to ensure  we got everything back on track not just for NNL but other leagues”.
Continuing, the LMC Boss said “all will be sorted out accordingly as soon as normalcy returns to various activities. We should all appreciate the difficult terrain the leagues are operating since the environment is not really clear and too toxic to drive the private investors confidence”.
“Well, we haven’t got to the bridge yet, so the issue of promoting teams with only five matches played can’t be a consideration at this moment. We hope all will be back to normal soon and we get everything sorted as planned by completing the seasons  across board”.
Dikko said that relegation and Promotion is part of league football and that’s what make it thick. He said  every season they organize special  seminar for promoted clubs to update them on what it’s expected of them and the processes among others. “it’s has worked very well” he said.
