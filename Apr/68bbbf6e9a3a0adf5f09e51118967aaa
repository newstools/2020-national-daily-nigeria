Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, has directed the immediate evacuation of all Almajeris from Plateau to their respective States of origin.

The Governor has also extended the total lockdown in the State indefinitely.

Arising from a press briefing on Thursday in Jos, Lalong said, “considering the grave danger that Almajiri children are exposed to as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am directing the immediate profiling and return of all Almajiris from Plateau State to their respective States of origin to join their families and guardians”, he said.

Lalong said the decision is in tandem with the resolution of the northern governors forum, which agreed to act in unison to protect these vulnerable children and further reduce the chance for the spread of the disease.

On the extension of lockdown, the Governor said the current total lockdown will be relaxed from midnight Thursday 23rd April to 26th April 2020 to enable people re-stock their homes, adding that the lockdown will resume on Monday 27th April 2020.

Our correspondent reports that Lalong did not state when the lockdown which will continue on Monday will elapse, thereby making it indefinite.
