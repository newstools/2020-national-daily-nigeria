It’s no news that popular Nigerian artiste David Adeleke better known as Davido buys most of his songs.

Funny enough, Davido has not been hiding the fact that he doesn’t use his head to write his hits himself.

A lot of people have been using this to criticize him but does he care?

With this fact, comparing him with his long time music rival Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun professionally known as Wizkid sounds absurd because Wizkid writes most of songs without relying on any songwriter.

As the quarantine keeps getting people bored, celebrities in Nigeria have been looking for a way or the other to entertain their fans as much as possible.

Few hours ago, there was a hit writers battle between Peruzzi and Kiddominant which led to some shocking revelations about how Davido bought almost all his songs, but you can never shame the shameless, Davido reacted with his statement:

 “Shekpe!!!….at least I write that one”.
