The Governors’ Mandate Network on Friday berated Pastor Osagie Ize Iyamu over his insensitive to the plight of the country being threatened by coronavirus infection  in  appointing campaign directors while the country is being locked down.
Ize Iyamu appointed 13 directors for the administration his campaign organization in preparation for the 2020 governorship election in Edo State, even while the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had suspended activities towards conducting elections because of the ravaging coronavirus in Nigeria.
Ize Iyamu, governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State had explained that the appointments were to coordinate his campaign programme to position him for the primary election of the APC.
Chairman of the Governor’s Mandate Network, Earl Osaro Onaiwu, in a statement, Ize-Iyamu that at a time that people are preoccupied with how to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country, making  donations to strengthen health facilities in the country, the governorship aspirant has as priority  the composition of campaign team. Onaiwu was of the view that the desperation has disqualified Iyamu from becoming Edo State government. He decried that Ize Iyamu does not care about the people of Edo State but his parochial interest.
