The Federal Government has refused to be specific about the end of the lockdown it imposed on Lagos, Ogun, and the FCT in an effort to halt the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria.
It however hinges its decision to end or extend the restriction on civic responsibility, and the odds are high it will be extended.
No fewer than 190 cases have been confirmed so far. And experts believe the figure will rise as there are thousands of contacts to trace.
The government noted that it would be difficult to defeat coronavirus if citizens failed to observe directives meant to safeguard themselves and others.
According to Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, the behavior of Nigerians would determine that.
“If we don’t behave ourselves, it is likely that the lockdown will be extended, but if we behave ourselves, there might not be an extension and I hope we do so.
“If we stay at home for two weeks and we are doing everything we are supposed to do, we should be able to effectively contain the disease.
“My appeal to Nigerians is that they should obey the directives on social distancing, personal hygiene, and shun gatherings; after two weeks, we will resume our normal lives.
“But if they think it is a joke, then we may have to stay at home more than the two weeks,” Mohammed added.
