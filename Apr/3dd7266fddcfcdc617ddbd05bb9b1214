Super Eagles legend Daniel Amokachi has received a lot of comments from Nigerians for rating Chelsea Football Club long-term servant John Obi Mikel as the most successful soccer player to ever emerge from Nigeria.

Daniel ‘Da Bull’ Amokachi made the submission on a live program on Sports Radio 88.9 Brila FM few days ago when a caller asked him about his opinion on who is the best player to ever come from Nigeria since inception of the round leather game.

The former Everton Football Club striker played to the gallery by giving two answers, Amokachi said if we are to judge by individual talent, Austin Jay Jay Okocha is the best but on another look in terms of achievement, John Mikel Obi is the most successful player to ever wear the green and white.

Fans are having non of it as they claimed that Daniel Amokachi has disrespected his former teammates of the ‘Golden Generation’ like late the Rashidi Yekini, Finidi George, Victor Ikpeba, Emmanuel Amuneke and Sunday Oliseh while many protested for skillful maestro Austin Jay Jay Okocha and extremely decorated lanky forward, Kanu Nwankwo.

Recall that Daniel Amokachi was part of the Dream Team Atlanta 1996 that shocked the World by winning the Olympic Gold Medal alongside Emmanuel Amuneke, Victor Ikpeba, Sunday Oliseh, Austin Jay Jay Okocha and inspirational captain Nwankwo Kanu while he was also part of Super Eagles coaching crew led by Late Stephen Okechukwu Keshi in 2013 when John Obi Mikel shoulder the creative responsibilities to win Nigeria’s third Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa.

No doubt John Mikel Obi is one of the greatest player in the history of Nigerian Football in terms of achievements while Nwankwo Kanu also made his mark for Arsenal, Inter Milan, Ajax Amsterdam and Portsmouth.

Both Mikel and Kanu won the UEFA Champions League but Mikel also won EUROPA League. Furthermore, Mikel has won a senior trophy for Nigeria when he won the Cup of Nations in 2013 while individually Kanu Nwankwo won the African player of the year award twice and the last Nigerian to win it as Mikel could only finish second place to Yaya Toure in 2013.
