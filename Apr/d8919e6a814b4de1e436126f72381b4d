Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has said he will shut down transport operators, Churches and Mosques if they don’t adhere to the new rules set aside by government to checkmate the spread of the virus in getting into the State.

Lalong who spoke through the Secretary to the Government of the State (SGS), Prof. Danladi Atu, on Wednesday in Jos, said tricycles not carrying only one passenger and religious organizations not adhering to only 50 persons in a gathering will be shut down completely.

According to him: “we are concerned that transport operators are yet to fully comply and are carrying passengers as they previously did. We are calling them again for further engagement where they will be issued a last warning.

“Some religious organizations who floated the order for gathering more than 50 people last week have been invited by security agencies and have equally apologised and made undertaking not to violate government orders again”, he said.

The Governor added that as part of the enforcement of gathering for not more than 50 people especially during religious events, any group which disregards this directive will be shut down outrightly.

“If those gatherings of not more than 50 persons must hold, the organisers should adhere strictly to 2-meter distancing, provision of water and sanitizers at entrances”, Lalong said.
