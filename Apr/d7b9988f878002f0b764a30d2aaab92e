China is facing a monumental global stigma over perceived betrayal of countries of world on authentic information on coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, Mainland China.
China on Thursday engaged in a de rigueur defence of its accusation of global conspiracy on the secrecy of coronavirus. The coronavirus controversy gas exposed China to crisis of socially acceptability in the international community.
Accordingly, China’s foreign ministry on Thursday vehemently contested the global projection that coronavirus escaped from its scientific facility, referring to the World Health Organization (WHO) position that there is no evidence that coronavirus emanated from laboratory.
It was disclosed that US scientists were training the Chinese in a program called PREVENT well before the Chinese commenced work on the prevailing virus. The French government is also said to have assisted China to set up the Wuhan laboratory.
Global sources had told Fox News that “China “100 per cent” suppressed data and changed data. Samples were destroyed, contaminated areas scrubbed, some early reports erased, and academic articles stifled.”
But China maintained its argument relying on WHO statement. WHO had also frightened the world that there is no treatment for coronavirus yet from the outset infected persons have been recovering in Nigeria from isolation and treatment centres, including foreigners who brought the virus to Nigeria. What was the stimulus of the recoveries in Nigeria?
Today, China is being celebrated to gave discovered the medicals to contain coronavirus and want other countries of the world to patronage its medical products.
Meanwhile, China has its economy to promote in the international frontiers and cannot be in isolation from the international system. China has a strong battle to fight not to subdue but convince the world why it should not be socially isolated from the international system.
