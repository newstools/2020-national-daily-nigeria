The expressway from the Sunrise, Coconut axis via Mile II access way to the Apapa and Tincan Island ports in Lagos has been taken over by refuse. The Tincan Island portion of the road has been converted into dump site of refuse disposers, blocking access road to Nigeriaâ€™s seaport and business hub in Lagos. The scene has not only become embarrassing but causes traffic blockade to the Tincan Island Port, as well as transit journey to the Apapa Port. The adjacent lane to the Port entry points at Second Gate has been taken over by mountains of refuse, perhaps, dumped by people who do business on the outside of the port arena.
Several make-shift shops are erected behind the fence of the port by food vendors, cigarette and alcohol sellers, including other. Motorbike (okada) operators are having field day.
There are no residential houses near the port location. The refuse would, therefore, have been dumped by the food and other items sellers, who include sellers of plastic drinks, and water.
The situation is execrated by the ongoing road construction which also contributed its own heaps of rubble on certain parts of the road.
The environment has been made so dirty and constituting serious threat to human health.
Unfortunately, the Lagos State government do not seem to be perturbed about the filthy environment or deluge of refuse on the Tincan Island Port axis of the Apapa/Oshodi Expressway. The Ports authorities also shows no concern but several agencies are there collecting revenue from port users.
