The Covid-19 Task Force in Lagos has discharged 16 patients that recovered from the disease.
Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu made the announcement on Wednesday.
“I have more great news from our isolation facilities. 16 persons; 14 males and 2 females including three foreigners – one Briton, one Chinese and one Polish citizen have been discharged to join the society,” he tweeted.
“As our frontline health workers record successes in the battle against #COVID19, we are duty-bound as citizens to break the chain of transmission of the infection by staying safe at home, practicing social distancing and adopting the highest possible personal hygiene.
“We will continue to do our best as the government to cushion the effect of this lockdown by re-energising our welfare package. Please keep faith with us as we work to win this battle together. Thank you for your continued perseverance and patience.”
Lagos has been the epicentre of the pandemic in Nigeria, and has the highest number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
