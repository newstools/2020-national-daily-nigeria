The lockdown of Lagos State has been effective in the first two days. The major highways and business zones were deserted.  The roads were without the usual vehicular traffic and gridlocks.


Curiously, the dense gridlock at the Apapa Port eased out without enforcement of any security personnel. Port users could easily drive to different locations of their operations without hitches.

Shops were securely locked.

Security operatives- the Nigeria Police, the Civil Defence Corps – as well as traffic managers who include FRSC, LASTMA, etc, mounted road blocks at sensitive locations across the state.

The FRSC, LASTMA, Civil Defence and Police have been working assiduously to screen vehicles bringing in food products into Lagos State through the Ibadan expressway axis.

In the urban periphery, people could restrict themselves within their homes mainly during working hours but rush out at evening hours to open their shops.

Few medical dealers opened their shop, including food sellers, through the day.
Some of the exempted people who are on essential duty or involved in production and manufacturing in companies found it difficult getting to their companies. Commercial drivers were completely off the road.

However, several individuals took to social media raising alert of hunger, some even begging for help to get food to eat and survive.
Many are still waiting palliatives from government.
