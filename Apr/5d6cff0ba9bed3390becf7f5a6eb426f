American philanthropist and former general manager at Microsoft, Melinda Gates, wife to Microsoft mogul, Bill Gates has described the halting of funds by the United States to World Health Organization, at a time like this as dangerous.

In a tweet on her official Twitter handle, Melinda expressed concern stating that the universal body, World Health Organization is striving to ameliorate the impact the deadly virus has on global citizens and refusing to fund the body will only amount to sheer wickedness.

It would be recalled that President of the United States, Donald Trump recently halted funding the United Nations’ Health Organization over perceived poor handling of the Coronavirus pandemic.

The President said US funding would be suspended while a review was conducted to assess the WHO’s “role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus”.

President Trump accused the organization of being too lenient with China in the earliest days of the pandemic, causing unnecessary deaths.

He said the group had promoted China’s “disinformation” about the virus that likely led to a wider outbreak of the pandemic.
