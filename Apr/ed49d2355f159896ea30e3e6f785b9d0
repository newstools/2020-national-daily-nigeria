The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has commended Nigeria’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Guterres, who spoke at a virtual news briefing in New York, the United States, singled out Nigeria as one of the developing countries that have “shown a remarkable capacity to respond to the disease.”
“I have to say this; some of these developing countries have shown a remarkable capacity to respond.
“I was quite impressed to see, for instance, Nigeria putting in place and immediately establishing a hospital. And I saw difficulties in countries that are much more developed to do quickly the same.”
The Nigerian government had put in place several measures to tackle the coronavirus since February 7 when the country recorded its first case of the virus.
Nigeria currently has 190 confirmed cases of coronavirus with two deaths.
However, 20 persons had been discharged from the hospital and isolation centres after they were given a clean bill of health by medical practitioners.
