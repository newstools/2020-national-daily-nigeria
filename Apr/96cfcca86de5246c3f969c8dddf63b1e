President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday directed states and security operatives across the country not to obstruct movement of essential goods during the period of the extension of lockdown. The President in a statement on Tuesday by the media office, observed that in the light of the directive in the national broadcast on Monday, the Presidency has received reports that   large number of food trucks are being delayed at various checkpoints around the country or prevented from crossing state borders, as a result of the curfews and lockdowns in the various states.
The President emphasized that restrictions of movement to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic do not apply to vehicles transporting essential commodities, such as food.
President Buhari declared: “The country cannot afford a situation where agricultural products are being left to rot in trucks held at various checkpoints, when millions of Nigerians across the country need food. COVID-19 or no COVID-19, Nigerians need to eat.”
The president added that other essential items that can be transported despite the ban on movement as prescribed by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) include: pharmaceutical and sanitary supplies, personal care items, agro chemicals and agricultural machinery, electrical products and electronics, oil and gas, courier services, health supplies and protective garments.
President Buhari insisted that vehicles transporting essential items must not convey commercial passengers; in addition, the occupants must not exceed three, i.e. the driver, spare driver, and conductor.
He stated that the drivers must have basic protective and sanitary items, including: face masks, hand sanitisers, and tissue paper to and fro their destinations.
“Once these conditions are satisfied, they must be allowed to travel freely to and from any part of Nigeria,” the president said.
