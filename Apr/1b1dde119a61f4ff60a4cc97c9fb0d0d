A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has accused the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration of favoring the northern part of the country in the sharing of COVID-19 palliatives.
The activist, in a post on his Twitter page, on Sunday, alleged that only twelve percent of the cash transfer to the ‘poorest of the poor’ in the country had gone to the entire South, while eighty-eight percent remained in the Northern part of the country.
He also alleged that the COVID-19 lockdown was more enforced in the South than in the North.
“General @MBuhari continues to focus 88% of his so called Conditional Cash Transfer in Northern Nigeria, and only 12% in the entire South, there may eventually be social upheaval in the South, where the #Coronavirus lockdown is more enforced than in the North,” he tweeted.
Omokri’s comments come after former military ruler, Ibrahim Babangida, urged Nigerians not to politicize the ongoing efforts to rid the country of coronavirus but rather join hands to defeat the scourge.
IBB in his Easter message to Christians across the country, said this period calls for a concerted effort by all to wage a total war against the killer disease.
