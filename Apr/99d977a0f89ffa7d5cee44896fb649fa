In  its resolve to contain the spread of Covid-19 Nigeria, the federal government has extended the lockdown declared in Abuja, Lagos, and Ogun two weeks ago—with additional two weeks.
President Muhammadu Buhari said this in a nationwide broadcast on Monday.
According to him, the extension came after he had “ carefully considered the briefings and report from the Presidential Task Force and the various options offered.”
“It has become necessary to extend the current restriction of movement in Lagos and Ogun States as well as the FCT for another 14 days effective from 11:59 pm on Monday, 13th of April, 2020.
“I am therefore once again asking you all to work with Government in this fight.
“This is not a joke. It is a matter of life and death. Mosques in Makkah and Madina have been closed. The Pope celebrated Mass on an empty St. Peter’s Square.
“The famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris held Easter Mass with less than 10 people. India, Italy and France are in complete lockdown. Other countries are in the process of following suit. We cannot be lax. ”
