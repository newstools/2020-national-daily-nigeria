Former Nigeria international Taye Taiwo said he was accused by Manchester United fans for helping Manchester City win the Premier League title in the 2011/2012 season.
Taiwo said that City needed an outright win against relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers to clinch their first league title since 1968.
Former National team player added that Title challengers Manchester United who were then champions, needed to beat Sunderland away and hope QPR stop City from winning.
But a dramatic stoppage time goal by Sergio Aguero, who beat Taiwo on loan to QPR from AC Milan before blasting the ball into the net to make it 3-2, ended City’s long wait for a league title.
“They said I allowed Man City win because Yaya Toure was there because my former teammate Samir Nasri (at Marseille) was there.
Taiwo concluded that the game was difficult for me because if I had touched Aguero it was going to be a penalty, so I didn’t have any option.”.
