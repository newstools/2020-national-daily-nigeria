Super Eagles star and Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi was top tackler in the Premier League in his first full season in England and also made the most tackles last term,National Daily learnt.
  Despite missing six league games through injury this term, only two players in Ricardo Pereira (119) and Aaron Wan-Bissaka (99) have racked up more tackles than the Nigeria international who has 91.
This season, Ndidi has made 61 interceptions and 194 recoveries, and has won 181 duels and 59 aerial battles.
Though the stats tell a story about his defensive qualities, the Foxes number 25 is not resting on his laurels and has praised manager Brendan Rodgers for making him a better player.
“He’s given me a wider view of where this is supposed to go to make me even better,” Ndidi said of Rodgers in a recent interview in LCFCQ Issue 11.
“The statistics are okay, but I can be better than that – that’s the way I can explain it.
” Ndidi has registered his name on the scoresheet twice this season, against Chelsea and Newcastle United in the Premier League.
