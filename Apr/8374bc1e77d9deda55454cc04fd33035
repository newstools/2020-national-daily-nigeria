Adewale Mayowa Emmanuel, known professionally as Mayorkun, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, and pianist. He released a cover of Davido’s “The Money” single and was discovered by the singer on Twitter.

However, he now has a new title — Mayor of Lagos. This is coming from the backdrop of a single he recently released. The Mayor of Lagos has now introduced the Pouncing Cat dance. And he has challenged all of his followers to key in.

We have had Zanku Leg work, Shaku Shaku, Gwara Gwara, Two slides, and the rest but there has been creativity at its peak.
