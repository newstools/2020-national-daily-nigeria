The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) is asking President Muhammadu Buhari to lighten the total lockdown on Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja.
A letter dated April 24, 2020 and signed by NGF chairman, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, addressed to SGF and Chairmana of the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 Boss Mustapha.
The governors make demand on: “Inter-state lockdown, excluding movement of essential supplies- food, beverages, medical and pharmaceutical, petroleum supplies and agricultural products; internal free movement but with restrictions on large gatherings and assemblies; overnight curfews; lockdown of flights; and compulsory use of face masks/coverings in the public.”
Fayemi said NGF’s position was a follow up to a teleconference meeting with the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, on April 22, 2020.
“Recall at the meeting it was agreed that the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) articulates the issues that it would want to be included in the next Presidential Pronouncement on COVID-19 so as to have a Uniform and coordinated Policy on COVID-19 at both the national and sub-national levels,” he added.
Nigeria currently has 1095 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country, with 208 discharged and 32 deaths.
