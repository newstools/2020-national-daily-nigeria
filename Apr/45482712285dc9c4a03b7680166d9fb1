In the report, the NCDC said a total number of 7154 tests have been conducted so far while 9221 people of interest have been identified.
Of the positive cases, 210 had travel history, 175 were contacts of those with travel history, 16 persons were unknown sources while 92 were “incomplete”.
However, 159 recoveries have been made while 17 fatalities have been recorded, unfortunately.

Its therefore apparent that majority of the victim, who are young, have stronger immunity and no serious undelying sicknesses.
Most of the dead victim are within the ages of 50 and 80.
