Former National U-23 team coach, Imama Amakpakabo says players in the Nigerian Professional Football League, NPFL, do not have enough qualities to play for the Super Eagles.
Coach Imama revealed that Nigeria’s best players are not found in the NPFL.
The statement follows recent comments by the NFF President, Amaju Pinnick that Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr must begin to watch NPFL matches with a view to identifying players he can call up to play in the national team.
“We should forget about running away from the truth. If you tell the people a lie for a very long time, they tend to believe the lie.
“Do an assessment, who are the players in the league that can compare with the players in Europe right now? Whichever we have right now that is doing very well in the league, in the next three months is going to be in Europe,” he said.

The former Rangers of Enugu gaffer said the concern should be on why many of the country’s players are always leaving the shores of Nigeria at every given opportunity.
