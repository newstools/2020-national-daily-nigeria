The scientific experimentation of Dr. Denise Faustman, Director of Immunobiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, on the use of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine as therapy for coronavirus, has stimulated public health decisions in Australia and the Netherlands, including other countries, to commence human clinical trials to study the BCG vaccine’s efficacy. Faustman had articulated the high probability of using Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine as therapy for the dreaded coronavirus ravaging countries of the world and threatening the continuous existence of human race on earth.
It was gathered that Dr. Faustman and her team have begun preparations for Boston trials, which was said to be under a multistep review process. The team projects recruit about 4,000 healthcare workers for the human clinical trial.
The research postulation is that the BCG vaccine could help people build immune responses to other diseases outside of tuberculosis, which causes off-target effects.
Faustman had declared:”BCG is heralded by the World Health Organization as the safest vaccine ever developed in the world. Greater than 3 billion people have gotten it while several countries, including the United States, do not regularly administer the BCG vaccine, it is still used widely in developing countries.”
However, the US, through its regulatory agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has not yet approved any vaccine or treatment for coronavirus in the country but there have been clinical trials.
