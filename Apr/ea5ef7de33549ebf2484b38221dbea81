The management of County Hospital, Ogba, Lagos, has debunked reports that the hospital has been shut down or infested after treating coronavirus patient. The hospital denied contact with any coronavirus carrier and therefore, has no reason to shut or be shut down by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
County hospital, Ogba, Lagos was listed among the tertiary health facilities shut down in Lagos by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) because of the Coronavirus pandemic. The action of the NCDC may not be unconnected with the demise of late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari who died in a private tertiary hospital in Lagos where he was receiving treatment after he tested positive to coronavirus.
Meanwhile, tertiary medical facilities shut down in Lagos include St. Edwards Hospital, Ajah, Lagos; Premier Specialists’ Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos; Verdic Lifecare Hospital, Lekki, and First Cardiology Consultants Hospital, Ikoyi, Lagos.
The hospitals further ordered immediate coronavirus test on their staff, family and anyone visitor or patient in the last 10 days. Some have done decontamination – fumigation – of the building.
