The ravaging coronavirus pandemic now poses serious threats to health facilities in Nigeria, forcing tertiary hospitals in the country to cease operations and shut down. The hospitals are not only shut down till further notice but are directing their staff and clients to go for coronavirus test.
National DailyÂ had earlier reported that some persons who returned from overseas went into hiding on arrival in Nigeria and refused to present themselves for coronavirus test or isolation. It was further reported that most of them are taking to private medical treatment. Paradoxically, the voluntary closure of the tertiary hospitals in Lagos known to be patronized by the rich may not be unconnected to treatment of coronavirus patients, unknowingly. The practice may have begun to have bandwagon effects.
Verdic Lifecare Hospital had on Monday issued a statement notifying the public of the closure of the hospital, directing staff to go for coronavirus test. Verdic management disclosed that a patient recently discharged from the hospital later tested positive to coronavirus and has been taken to isolation centre. Some other hospitals have been listed to have shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Some of the hospitals include St. Edwards Hospital, Ajah, Lagos; Premier Specialist Hospital, Victoria Island; First Cardiology Consultants Hospital, Ikoyi, Country Hospital, Ogba.
However, the shut down was said to eb temporary to enable of the health facilities be decontaminated.
