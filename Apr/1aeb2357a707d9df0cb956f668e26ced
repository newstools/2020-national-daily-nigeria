The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said that the ongoing laying of fibre optic cables and the deployment of other telecoms equipment by mobile network operators (MNOs) across Lagos and other states is not connected to the controversial 5G network.


Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta in a statement said the deployment is entirely to expand their networks infrastructure across the country to provide more efficient services to the consumers.
Danbatta made this clarification in response to serious concerns being expressed that some ongoing digging/excavation activities and laying of fibre optic cables by MNOs in Lagos and in some other states are connected to 5G equipment deployments.
According to Danbatta, “As we speak, any information suggesting or claiming that the equipment being deployed by the network operators are 5G equipment is purely misinformation deliberately orchestrated by individuals bent on creating ill-feelings in the industry.”
In reaction to concerns about the ongoing digging and fibre optic cable laying by some operators, he said they are in accordance with agreements reached during meetings by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami and Management of the NCC with the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) led by Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Executive Governor of Ekiti State in January 2020, during which the Forum gave its commitment to allow the network operators expand their networks by granting right of way (RoW) approvals for telecommunications infrastructure expansion, unhindered, across their states. This will significantly reduce drop calls and improve networks performance of the operating companies.
