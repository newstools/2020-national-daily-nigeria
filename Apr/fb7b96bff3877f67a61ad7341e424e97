In response to the current crisis resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the entrepreneurship-focused African philanthropy, the Tony Elumelu Foundation, has announced the difficult decision to postpone the 6th edition of its Entrepreneurship Programme and the TEF Forum until 2021.”
Meanwhile, TEF assured 2020 eligible applicants that they can still go ahead to the next stage and will not need to reapply, however, the “foundation will double its own commitment to select 2000 entrepreneurs (1000 entrepreneurs for 2020 cohort and 1000 entrepreneurs for 2021 cohort) instead of annual selection of 1000 entrepreneurs. Thus, there will be no lost opportunities for the 2020 applicants to the programme.”

TEF advised the general public to take prevent measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.
