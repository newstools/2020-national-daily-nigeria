He added that with the fate of many leagues across the world in the balance, some stakeholders say the NPFL should be concluded and Plateau declared winners.
LMC boss revealed that for now, they are studying and reviewing various scenarios and options on what to do, depending on when we are able to resume.
Dikko said that they  have to take  the decision CAF and FIFA will take regarding continental competitions, international competitions, regulatory issues like internal match calendar, transfer wi6dow, registration, deadlines and next season’s competitions etc
He concluded that it’s clearly premature to start thinking of any straight line option like you suggest. What we are all working now as first option is hoping that this precarious situation with coronavirus would be resolved soonest and normalcy return to enable us conclude the season.”
