A private hospital has been shut down for decontamination after a patient discharged from the hospital later tested positive to coronavirus. Two staffers of the hospital also tested positive to coronavirus, thereafter. They are all at the isolation centres where they are being attended to by the National Centre for Disease (NCDC).
The management of the hospital, Vedic Lifecare Hospital, in a statement on Monday noted that both the patient and two staffers of the hospital are yet to show symptoms of coronavirus even after testing positive.
The management said that all staffers have been maintaining the mandatory PPE gear in the last 25 days.
The management stated that the hospital has been shut down for decontamination of the building. They disclosed that the fumigation had already been done by NCDC officials on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the hospital management is currently testing the remaining staffers, promising to make update public. The management further directed anyone that visited the hospital in the past 10 days to go for testing and be isolated.
