The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikorodu Branch has petitioned the Lagos State Commissioner for Justice over the rising insecurity in the state in the last one week.
The letter tagged “Safety and Security for Lagosians” and signed by the chairman of the branch, Bayo Akinlade, urged for a reactivation of the law during the lockdown as lives and properties are at risk.
Making reference to the recent robberies in the Agege area of Lagos, Akinlade underscored the need to put in place adequate machinery to fight crime and insecurity.
“With the current situation in the Agege area of Lagos, it is becoming obvious that insecurity may claim more lives than the COVID -19 pandemic if not addressed urgently.
“I also suggest that we put more faith in our community leaders, local government, traditional rulers, religious leaders, philanthropist and family unit heads to liaise with the Police within the community to ensure the safety of lives and properties.
“Similarly, we should attempt to create an equal playing field for everyone to determine their own interest. In this regard, we need to come up with a unique way to fight this pandemic,’’ he said.
He said that during the pendency of the COVID-19 lockdown, he was volunteering to assist as a legal practitioner to redress wrongs.
“As Chairman of NBA Ikorodu Branch and a Lagosian, I am at your service to do what is necessary to support the government. “I am bound to speak for the voiceless of my community,’’ he concluded.
