Several Nigerians have scolded President Muhammadu Buhari for neglecting the welfare of citizens during the period of lockdown in the fight to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country. The citizens decried what they considered huge fraud in the claimed palliatives assumedly distributed by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.
The rage of Nigerians was precipitated when a Nigerian resident in Canada on his Twitter handle- @chuks.Japhet – disclosed that the Canadian government gives citizens resident in the country over N626,000 as palliatives to stay at home.
The responses from Nigerians at home of were sharp on negative indices. One quickly told the Nigerian resident in Canada to nationalise immediately and never come back to Nigeria. Another was of the view that Nigeria as a country is a course.
A Nigerian painted a hopeless graphic situation back home. “My dear, in naija, if police do not kill you, army will do the work; if you escape army, civil defence will do that. And if you make mistake and escape all these, then, ‘yam banza’ herdsmen, bandits and others will surely finish the work. So, don t talk of money please,” he declared. For this citizen, the Nigerian government offers no good to citizens except evil.
Another citizen simply warned the Nigerian resident in Canada not to talk about the palliatives in Canada again to avoid Lai Mohammed coming to arrest him there with Interpol and bring back to Nigeria, accusing him of blackmail.
A citizen, however highlighted: “the money comprises of both state and federal assistance palliatives with your GST goods and services tax returns. The money is paid monthly and will be paid for six months. Canada takes care of people, Nigeria takes care of cows.”
The Nigerian President was told to seek capable citizens to help him in governance.
