The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday raised alarm over the recent spate of fire outbreaks at key Federal Government agencies and departments, particularly in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.
The party expressed shock over the provoking fire disaster at the head office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja, on Friday, in which valuable equipment and documents related to electoral and political party monitoring were destroyed.
The PDP described the situation as unsettling, recalling that only last Wednesday, the headquarters of the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation in Abuja was gutted by fire, followed by another inferno at the head office of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) just two days ago.
The party expressed deep worry, hoping that “the spate of fire outbreaks is not a coordinated design by sinister elements against demands for due process and accountability in our country, as already being insinuated in the public space.”
The PDP, therefore, restated its demand for a forensic investigation into the fire outbreaks in the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, the CAC and now INEC, as the spate of occurrence has become alarming.
Furthermore, the PDP strongly charged the Federal Government to immediately ensure necessary precautionary and security measures to safeguard all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to avert such ugly incidences.
The PDP noted that the nation can no longer afford any more fire incident in key institutions as such will be distressing to the polity, which is already under pressure occasioned by dwindling economy and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
