A High Court has ordered security operatives to desist from harassing or attacking journalists on duty during the coronavirus lockdown endorsement.
On its judgment on petitions from the journalist association, it was said that “The High Court has directed that… arrests or detention or other forms of harassment must stop.”
It was gathered that the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) and journalist Panashe Makufa petitioned the court seeking the order of restraint after frequent incidence wherein the police and other law enforcement agencies harassed or arrested journalists while performing their duties.
Counsel to the petitioners, Chris Mhike, was said to have remarked that “The police and all others who are working with the police in enforcing the rules of the lockdown have been interdicted from carrying out those actions that amount to harassment of journalists.”
The presiding Judge, Jacob Manzunzu, in the ruling, was said to have issued the police hierarchy 12 hours to inform its members and other law enforcement agencies involved in enforcing the lockdown that the 2019 press card is valid.
Some police officers had contested the expiry dates of official press cards, insisting that journalists present letters of exemption in addition to the cards.
It was said that the government had classified journalists as those on essential service during the lockdown.
The police had countered that “all journalists are not exempted from the lockdown.” The police maintained that only journalists “from broadcasting and internet” media were exempted in the lockdown.
