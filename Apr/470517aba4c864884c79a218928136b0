The apex Christian body in Nigeria, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has called on Christian families to set aside thirty minutes each day for the next seven days to praise the beauty of God’s Holiness with effect from Monday, April 20 to Sunday, April 26, 2020.
In a statement signed by the President of CAN, Rev. Supo Ayokunle and mad available to National Daily on Wednesday, he thanked all leadership of Christian bodies for their exceptional qualities in making sure all churches participated in the last twenty four hours prayer chain declared by CAN last week
“Soon after that prayer, the Lord ministered strongly to my spirit that we should take  step further in winning the battle over many challenges facing our nation and the church in Nigeria, especially, the present rampaging COVID-19 pandemic by using Paul & Silas’ praise approach (Acts 16: 25-26) to provoke further divine intervention.
According to Rev. Ayokunle, God inhabits the praises of his people because praise is the big gun of faith which when triggered can accomplish a lot in the spiritual realm, hence the need for Christian families to be fully involved in this next phase.
“I believe that if we do this with one accord, God will do something very positive soon for us, not only by wiping away the global COVID-19 pandemic, but by also helping us to overcome other challenges facing our dear country and the body of Christ in Nigeria,” he added.
