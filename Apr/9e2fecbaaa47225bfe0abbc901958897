The Nigerian Immigration Service Comproller Mohammed Babandede was the first among government officials and politically exposed Nigerians to reflect on his state after coing down with Covid-19 in March.
“I thank Allah for giving me the opportunity to be sick because it gives me the opportunity to humble myself,” he said in a short video on April 1.
Kaduna Gov. Nasir el-Rufai might have also gone through a similar refinery.
His letter  from quarantine where he has been since he tested positive for the disease reverberates with sobriety and brokenness.
In a statement through his Special Adviser Muyiwa Adekeye, the governor felicitated with the Christian community on the occasion of Easter, congratulating them on the completion of Lent, with its discipline of fasting, prayers and charity.
“Just as the pains and humiliation of the Crucifixion ended in the triumph of the resurrection, today’s difficulties shall provide renewal, a chance to give thanks anew to Almighty God,” the statement said in part .
“The governor urged the Christian community to keep hope alive even in these dire moments. He said that with careful attention to preventive measures, humanity will rise above the devastations and disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, the uniquely difficult circumstances the COVID-19 pandemic has created which has impacted on formal acts of worship to celebrate Easter.
He observed that the enduring message of Easter, of victory over darkness, is especially poignant amidst the uniquely difficult circumstances in which Easter is being celebrated this year.
So he urged Christians to observe social distancing and other measures in the effort to contain the Covid-19 spread.
The governor got a bad rap from Christians last year when he moved to legislate against public worship, either by Christians or Muslims,  in the state.
