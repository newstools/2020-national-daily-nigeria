Osimhen added that Lille is still a great club to play for,i want to have more playing time and make my team proud.
Osimhen explained that he held talks with former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger over a move to the North Lodon club in 2015, but ultimately decided that German club Wolfsburg was the best place for him to continue his development.
Super Eagles striker explained that he failed to make an impact at the club, and was eventually sold to Belgian outfit Charleroi.
He joined French Ligue 1 outfit Lille last summer and has scored 18 goal with six assists in 38 appearances in all competitions.
Speculation over Osimhen’s future with Lille looks set to intensify in the coming months and he has now admitted that he could have already been on the books of one of the world’s biggest clubs if he’d opted for a different path as a teenager.
Osimhen is close friends with Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo who is currently on loan at Old Trafford from Shanghai Shenhua – and says his compatriot has advised him over a possible switch to the Premier League.
