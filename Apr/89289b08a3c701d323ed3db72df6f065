A former governor of Plateau State, Ambassador Fedelis Tapgun, has warned Nigerians not to rejoice over the death of President Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, who died as a result of being infected with the deadly Coronavirous deceased.
“We were created to love one another, people only grow up to be wicked. Now that Kyari is dead, it is only God that will judge him not us”, he said.
The death of Kyari was announced to Nigerians on Saturday morning April 18th by the Presidency.
Buhari’s office had announced in a statement that it “regrets to announce the passage” of Abba Kyari, who acted as gatekeeper to the president of Africa’s most populous nation.
The deceased had tested positive to the ravaging COVID-19, and had been receiving treatment. But he died on Friday, April 17, 2020, the statement said.
However, reacting to the unfortunate incident, Tapgun who was also a former Minister of the federal republic of Nigeria, warn his countrymen not to jubilate over the death of the late Chief of Staff.
“I don’t think it is proper to rejoice over anyone’s death: we are all creatures of God and God did not create us to be wicked.
“What death teaches us is that we are all mortal, we shall die one day. So whatever we are doing we should think twice.
“I commensurate with the federal government and his family in particular, because his family will feel the lost more than anyone of us”, Tapgun said.
Our correspondent reports that  Kyari, in his 70s, was the highest-profile COVID-19 death in the West African country, which has 493 confirmed cases and 17 deaths, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
