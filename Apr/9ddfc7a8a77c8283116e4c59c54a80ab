The Directorate of State Security in Edo State, on Monday denied reports alleging that its operatives invaded the home of the former Chief of Staff to Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, Mr. Taiwo Akerele.
The Edo State Director of the DSS, Sheikh Waziri, who made the denial in Benin City on Monday, also denied arresting anyone associated with Akerele.
According to Waziri, no operative of the service invaded Akerele’s residence on Sunday.
It would be recalled that reports had said operatives of the DSS had allegedly invaded Akerele’s residence on Sunday, arresting his Personal Assistant, Jaspa Olowojoba in the process.
“I have verified and confirmed that the DSS Edo has not invaded the residence, nor arrested anyone associated with the former CoS,” Waziri said.
Akerele resigned his appointment as Chief of Staff to Obaseki on Saturday, saying he was doing it on principle. He was replaced with Mr. Osaze Uzamure.
