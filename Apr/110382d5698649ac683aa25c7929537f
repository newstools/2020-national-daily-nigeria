Father of a retired officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), who came back home in Ekiti from Lagos obstructed the Lagos returnee from entering the house except he presents certifications that he is not infected with Coronavirus.
A video of the Ekiti man insisting that his son presents “proper certification” to prove that he is immune to coronavirus infection before he is allowed into the house on his return from Lagos went viral on social media.
The father compelled the returnee son that they both go to the Ekiti State office of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the mandatory two weeks isolation of his son before he will be admitted into the home.
The Ekiti father was said to have disclosed that he told his son not to come home but stay in Lagos which is known to be the epicentre of coronavirus in Nigeria until the coronavirus pandemic is conquered in the country. He decried that his son ignored him and traveled from Lagos to Ekiti State while lockdown is being enforced by the state governments.
The father complained he was afraid of home transmission of coronavirus if he allows his Lagos returnee son access into the house. So, he insisted that his son must observe the 14 days mandatory isolation before being granted entrance into the house.
The coronavirus fragmented father narrated similar experience where he said a 29-year-old pregnant community health worker died from coronavirus after sneaking into Ekiti State from Lagos.
