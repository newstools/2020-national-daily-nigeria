Africa has made breakthrough in the global search for coronavirus remedy. Malawi has discovered herbal treatment/remedy for the prevention of the spread of coronavirus in the country.

The herbal therapy, COVID-Organic, was launched by the President of Malawi, Andry Rajoelina, in the Malawian capital this week.

The government has made it available for citizens towards preventing the spread of coronavirus.

Malawi unveiled the Organic after a High Court restrained the government from enforcing lockdown order in the country.
