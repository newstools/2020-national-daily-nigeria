The federal government is encouraging Nigerian farmers to defy COVID-19 virus, and return to farm.
Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) for COVID-19, said this would avert food crisis as Nigeria was currently battling with health and economic challenges.
He spoke during the daily PTF press briefing on COVID-19 in Abuja, yesterday.
“​I also wish to use this opportunity to restate that food security and self-sufficiency remain important to our national life.
“I therefore, urge all our farmers to begin to prepare for their return to the farms as the planting season.
“The Federal Ministry of Agriculture has put in place arrangements for access to farm inputs, extension and others services,” Mustapha said.
The UN has warned that many countries, including Nigeria, may be tottering on the brink of famine in the wake of the pandemic.
