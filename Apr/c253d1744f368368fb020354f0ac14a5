The Special Military Taskforce code named Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), has said the Force will deal with crime merchants, who are fueling crisis and profiting from it.

The OPSH mandate to restore peace in Plateau State, some parts of Bauchi and Southern Kaduna, said most of the crisis bedeviling the region are influenced by trouble machineries, vowing to deal decisively with anyone caught in the act.

Speaking in a routine familiarization visit to traditional rulers on Monday, the Taskforce Commander, Maj. Gen. Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, said to bring an end to the wanton killings often ignited by crisis, the monarchs must work in synergy with the Force to fish out the saboteur amongst them.

Okonkwo added that his Command has also identified other flash point areas of troubled spots, saying that he is fashioning lasting strategies to combat them.

According to him: “Our operation would improve on the security situations across the Joint Operational Area through constant dialogues with relevant stakeholders, which forms part of the non-kinetic activities adopted by the operation to stem wanton killings in the State.

“OPSH would not be overwhelmed in its duty and remain professional and neutral in discharging its mandate. Anyone found sponsoring crimes to the detriment of the State will be dealt with”, the Army boss said.

However, while making reference to the recent face-off between the Fulani and Irigwe communities in the State, Okonkwo said both factions have pledged to embrace peace.

He revealed that for proactive steps to be taken in combating crime, timely and prompt information should be made available to the OPSH.
