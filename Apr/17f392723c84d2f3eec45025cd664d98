Samklef expressed himself in a series of tweets:

“My dear proud Nigeria artiste una see say this life Na nothing. Coronavirus don put everything on hold. 2 female artist that fame enter dem head Simi x Yemi @alade I greet una”

” Ycee wey start yesterday 2 that year I reach out to am my no even respond. But this life sha. Make I Comot all the things wey dey mind today Incase world end I no go carry am go heaven. So one day I dey South Africa with my guy Lekan I come see Yemi Alade come greet her.”

“Even WiZkid wey blow pass dem hundred times still dey chat with me once once. But this one common small knock out sound dem don arrive”

THEY REPLIEF:

Yemi Alade and singer, Ycee has both fired warning shots at music producer Samklef for dragging them, while Simi ignored him.

Ycee said, “I’ve been making music since 2011 OG You reached out to me to work with your artist not with you, at the time I was under management (which we all know how they were now). You’ve made several snide remarks about this and I have ignored Please I have mad respect for you baba”.

And Yemi Alade also replied thus, “Pride… is evil. Alot of people think the world revolves around them. don’t be bitter, be better.”

However, Singer Simi is yet to respond to the dragging as at the time of writing this report.
