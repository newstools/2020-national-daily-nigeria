as Coronavirus takes toll on NFF finances

Nigeria Football Federation President Amaju Pinnick says Super Eagles players may start earning their match and performance-related bonuses in Naira as the NFF starts to feel the pinch from the coronavirus pandemic.
Pinnick  revealed this information on Channels TV ,National Daily monitored .
The NFF boss said the decision which is currently being looked at amid other “very difficult decisions” being considered by the federation as they prepare for the realities of a post-coronavirus world, will help “promote [Nigeria’s] fiscal policy”
The Delta-state born administrator was responding to a question about why new contract terms for Eagles manager Gernot Rohr includes a stipulation that the 66-year-old must accept to be paid in Naira while national team players are paid in dollars.
“When the players play in Nigeria, their bonuses have been in Naira but when they play abroad, they will be paid in dollars,” Pinnick clarified.
“But that style will change because like I’ve said we are going to make so many difficult decisions that will go across board because we need to promote our fiscal policy.
“If the government is saying that we need to strengthen our naira, we shouldn’t be paying in dollars. We are an integral part of the government and we must support everything the government is doing.
“We don’t need the government to tell us to do this we know that is we pay in Naira, it would strengthen our Naira then why not.”
