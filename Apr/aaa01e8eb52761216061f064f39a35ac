Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr revealed that with his current contract set to expire in June,he has been receiving offers from few countries, National Daily learnt.
The former Bordeaux manager has been in charge of Nigeria’s national team since 2016, but he is into the final two months of his current deal.
While there have been discussions over a renewal, nothing has been sealed yet, with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president, Amaju Pinnick, saying Rohr will have to accept to their new terms before a deal can be agreed.
Although Rohr already hinted he has no problem with the conditions laid out,  a few countries have offered him the chance to manage their national teams.
However, he turned down those offers because he wants to continue with Nigeria, and he is waiting for NFF’s proposal.
“Personally, I had a few offers from other countries, I refuse them because I said I am still on a contract, and I want to finish my work with Nigeria and to go to the next AFCON and to go to the World Cup, which means we should continue,” Rohr said.
Speaking on the meeting he had with Pinnick in February, Rohr said he couldn’t share the details, but hinted he would have to discuss with his assistants before accepting any offer.
