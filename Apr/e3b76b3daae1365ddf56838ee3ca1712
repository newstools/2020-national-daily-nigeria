The Lagos government began house-to-house search for citizens living with Covid-19, and the outcome so far will be frightening as the Covid-19 team uncovers scores of people with symptoms related to the virus..
State Commissioner for Health Akin Abayomi said a total of 119 people, out of the 118000 household searched, have showed such symptoms in Lagos.
The state boasts of the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in Nigeria.
“ The idea is to go to hot spots and go from door to door with our health personnel. So far, in the last two days, we’ve visited 118,000 households and we’re looking for the typical symptoms of COVID-19. We’ve identified about 119 people who have the symptoms that are suggestive of COVID-19,” he said at a press briefing Tuesday.
But he warned that suspects displaying the symptoms is not enough.
“Let me remind you that COVID-19 is one of the viruses that can cause respiratory symptoms.”
According to him, there are many viruses, and the search is not about every respiratory condition.
“The idea is to take samples from these 119 and analyse them and that would give us an idea of how much COVID-19 activity is happening in the communities,” Abayomi said
