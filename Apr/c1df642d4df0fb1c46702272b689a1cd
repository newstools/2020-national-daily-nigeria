Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr says he has held discussions with his newly appointed assistant, Joseph Yobo.
Yobo was appointed as Rohr’s assistant following the dismissal of Imama Amapakabo in February.
But when Yobo was announced as the new Super Eagles assistant manager, Rohr revealed he was not aware, and he has not spoken to the former Everton man.
The two were supposed to meet for the first time ahead of the Super Eagles Afcon qualifying clash against Sierra Leone last month.
But the doubleheader was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged almost all activities worldwide.
Rohr revealed Yobo has now contacted him, and they discussed at length.
The former Bordeaux manager revealed he was not able to get hold of Yobo because he did not have his number.  But they have now talked, and he even asked him to help out with some issues.
“We talked together.” He gave me a first call because I did not have his number, and then called him back, and we are in touch.
“I even ask him to help me already because I can’t move for the moment and to contact our players in Nigeria though they are not playing also,” Rohr added.
