Prince Badamasi told National Daily that for this pandemic issue, we have not cut any of thier salaries but what happened is that, I paid all team players on Friday, officials technical staffs everyone working for the club to keep up with the economy in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
He added that every club chairman is looking for the success of his  team and well being. Just like my own team, we’re not owing any match bonuses, although we know we’re not yet up to par as regards salary because of the present state of the country’s economy.
Badamasi who took over from Aminu Kurfi and has done so well to help reposition and rebrand THE CHANGI boys into a strong force in the NPFL as they’re currently 10th in the log.
