Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday declared war on criminals taking the advantage of the coronavirus lockdown to engage in armed robbery and cause unrest in boundary communities. The governor, accordingly, directed the security operatives not to spare anyone caught in armed robbery in the state.
Sanwo-Olu at a briefing after the State Security Council meeting at the State House, Marina, disclosed that over 100 miscreants have been apprehended by the police on account of disturbances, acknowledging that the Inspector General Police (IGP) had already deployed a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) from Abuja to lead a special force to burst criminal gangs breaching the peace in the border communities of Lagos and Ogun states.
Sanwo-Olu assured: “As an administration, we will live up to our responsibility of ensuring the security of the lives and property of all citizens. We will not abandon this responsibility at any time. There is no room whatsoever in Lagos for criminal gangs or miscreants of any kind.”
The governor maintained: “the Inspector General of Police has deployed a Deputy Inspector General of Police, who is a seasoned crime fighter, to Lagos as our Intervention Squad Coordinator to help devise and superintend over a superior strategy to curtail and stem the perceived and actual threat of violence.
“With this revised strategy, you will see an increase in mobile police deployment in all trouble spots in the metropolis; as well as the police intensifying their patrols around residential areas, boundary communities, and other critical areas of activities during this lockdown period.
“I urge all residents to obey the directive in all its entirety. Let us not be found wanting. Those who insist on flouting these directives will have no one but themselves to blame.”
