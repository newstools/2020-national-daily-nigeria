Kano Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has expressed his frustration with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 which he believes has neglected the state as the virus spreads fast among the citizens.
“We are in a serious problem. I can tell you the situation is really bad and scary. Because what we solely rely upon in fighting the disease is the testing centre,” the governor said in a BBC interview on Monday.
“There is also a shortage of sample collection equipment. It is not common equipment that you can go and buy in the market. Those whose samples were collected are still waiting to know their fate.”
According to him, the problem (is) with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF) and NCDC whose D-G has not been forth-coming on the situation in Kano.
President Muhammadu Buhari appointed  his SGF Boss Mustapha as chairman of the PTF.
“There is a serious problem. We have been complaining that Kano needs more than one testing centre, right from the beginning of this (pandemic),” the governor added.
He insisted during the interview the state is not getting deserved attention from the presidential committee, an expression that sounds harsh considering Ganduje’s chummy relationship with Buhari.
If these equipment (testing centres) are under our control, we will do our best to make sure it works properly. But we are not getting the needed support and co-operation from the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.”
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control as of Sunday night, 77 of the 1273 total cases recorded in the country were reported in Kano.
There have been dozens of death in the state, but its health authorities said only one was related to Covid-19.
The federal government has said the laboratory will be re-activated, and investigation will be carried out into the so called mysterious deaths in the state.
