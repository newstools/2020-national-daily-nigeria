Ex-International and  former National Team Coach Sunday Oliseh has revealed that  he will never coach  Super Eagles again.
Oliseh that was appointed Nigeria head coach in 2015 and he took charge of 14 international matches, but he resigned in the following year.
Legendary Nigerian midfielder said that he love coaching his country,but the atmosphere is not healthy to take the job.
Former Super Eagles Coach  explained that he doesnt  want the job anymore and am not too strong  Health-wise.
Oliseh added that NFF were owing salaries and he was spending money on his health and players.
Former International said that  Super Eagles have foreign coach now and from what I heard and know, he is being paid four times the wages Stephen Keshi and I were paid and these are two players who won trophies for Nigeria.
“I’ve never heard Gernot Rohr complain about wages. Keshi, while he was coaching, was always complaining, when I was coaching for four months, I was unpaid, for six months my assistants were unpaid, so I had to leave the job; we were also being frustrated.”
