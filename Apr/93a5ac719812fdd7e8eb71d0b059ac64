President Muhammadu Buhari in a national broadcast on Monday evening excluded Kano State from the modifications of the lockdown measures in the country. The president expressed his special attention to the case of increasing death rate in the state and his concern for urgent intervention.
President Buhari, accordingly, ordered immediate deployment of additional Federal Government human, material and technical resources to strengthen and support the Kano State Government in its efforts to contain the coronavirus deaths in the state. The President declared: “as we continue to streamline our response in the epicenters of Lagos and the FCT, I am concerned about the unfortunate developments in Kano in recent days.
“Although an in-depth investigation is still ongoing, we have decided to deploy additional Federal Government human, material and technical resources to strengthen and support the State Government’s efforts. We will commence implementation immediately.”
The president acknowledged that in Kano, and indeed, many other States that are recording new cases, preliminary findings show that such cases are mostly from interstate travel and emerging community transmission.
Thus, President Buhari excluded Kano State from the adjustments toward easing the lockdown in the country.
He maintained: “These revised guidelines will not apply to Kano State. The total lockdown recently announced by the State Government shall be enforced for the full duration. The Federal Government shall deploy all the necessary human, material and technical resources to support the State in controlling and containing the pandemic.”
