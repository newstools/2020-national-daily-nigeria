President Muhammadu Buhari has also been under pressure to end the lockdown under which he put Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja about two weeks ago.

“We are not out of the woods yet but we will be. And it won’t be too long but until the whole world has had a compulsory holiday,” he said in his Easter Sunday sermon on Dove TV.
As usual, he assured Nigeria the crisis we soon be over.
“If you have any doubt at all, the situation in the recent past should show you clearly that He is in control.
