Manchester United have taken their rebuilding process to the next level with the acquisition of Jadon Sancho.
Reports reaching National Daily reveal that the England international Jadon Sancho is understood to have agreed every aspect of his move to United.
Jadon Sancho who emerged one of the brightest and hottest superkid in the world football today has remained a subject of transfer speculation by top European clubs.
United are believed to have sorted almost every details of Sancho’s transfer to Old Trafford
However, National Daily can confirm from the report by SunSport that the Old Trafford side have sorted the details of Sancho’s transfer to United ranging from the length of his contract, his salary, bonuses and a huge buyout clause over the months of secret talks.
Meanwhile, National Daily further gathered that the Red Devils must now finalise a fee with Borussia Dortmund which is believed to become a record British club fee as the German club are determined to generate more than the £89 million United paid for the return of Paul Pogba from Juventus in 2016.
It is understood that the London born 20-year old Sancho is also of interest to Chelsea, but the England wonderkid who previously admired Ole Gunnar Solskjaer rebuilding process at United is rather keen on a move to Old Trafford.
Again, Dortmund chief Michael Zorc previously revealed United interest in Sancho last September: “A meeting did take place. United invited the agent.”
Winger Sancho was one of the first targets manager Solskjaer identified to transfer chief Ed Woodward.
Woodward is also backing Solskjaer with a move for Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish and by testing the water with Spurs over a deal for Harry Kane.
