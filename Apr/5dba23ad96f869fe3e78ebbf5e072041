Nigerians have continued from where they stopped in trolling Ayo Makun, aka AY. This time is his wife, Mabel Makun. They have made the comedian’s beautiful and curvy wife, Mabel Makun a troll item.

They are saying she must have gone through the knife to achieve her beautiful curves.

The comedian has come out to correct that notion and defend the wife that she has never done surgeries for her curves as she got those killer curves from her genes.

In his post on instagram, he said ” I do understand that a lot of people are bored this period with the lock down situation. But let’s find a way to leave the Makuns alone and concentrate on how to stay safe from the pandemic that has engulfed the nation and the rest of the world. No disrespect to people who do cosmetic surgery. I believe that they do it for so many reasons. Some want to look younger. Others seek to change a feature they’ve never liked. That decision should remain personal and highly respected as it becomes a boost to their self esteem.”
