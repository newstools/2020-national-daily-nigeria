A Twitter handle by the name Fulfilled Son just made a report online (Twitter) about a Police Woman killed in Port Harcourt by another Policeman in a Government’s Task Force. He made a four-tweet thread narrating the ordeal.

He tweeted, “When I say the Nigeria police needs orientation on handling arms people don’t take it serious.  Just happening now a female policewoman was gunned down at Eneka in Port Harcourt by Governor Wike’s Task Force team who came to chase people who were selling in a market.

“The female Police Officer who controls traffic at the market was shot down by a policeman. (Before the sad death, the female policewoman was actually begging on behalf of a shoe trader who was arrested by the policeman from the Taskforce Team).

“The policeman threatened to shoot the trader if he doesn’t stop resisting arrest. As he pointed the gun the trader dodged the bullet only for it to meet the female policewoman on her head.

“She left a 2-year-old child she just finished breastfeeding 30mins before she died. She normally leaves the child with her nanny at a shop at the Eneka first market junction”.

One of the replies he got on the thread confirms and privides an additional infomation of how the Police are now at the location carrying out mass arrest.

VeeKinky(Twitter Handle) tweeted, “I live at Eneka. This report is true. Everybody is running. @PoliceNG has started doing mass arrest”.

The Police is yet to make any statement yet.
