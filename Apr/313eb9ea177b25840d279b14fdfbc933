American communications technology giant, Zoom Video Communications Inc, has reported a 50% increase in the daily usage of the online meeting application in the past 3 weeks.
According to Bloomberg, the company reported that the number of users of Zoom’s flagship video conferencing app surged from 200 million people on April 1, 2020, to 300 million users by April 21, 2020.
This was disclosed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company, Eric Yuan, on Wednesday, during a webinar that was focused on security.
The CEO said, “Clearly the Zoom platform is providing an incredibly valuable service to our beloved users during this challenging time. We are thrilled and honoured to continue to earn the trust of so many enterprises, hospitals, teachers and customers throughout the world.”
It should be noted that before the coronavirus outbreak, Zoom was basically focused on business communications with about 10 million users globally.
In Nigeria, the lockdown and social distancing measures have opened up a lot of opportunities in the communications technology sector, as businesses and government institutions now work remotely. A lot of virtual meetings are being held, rather than physical meetings.
Training, seminars, tutorials by educational institutions, and others are held through video conferencing, web conferencing, webinars, and so on.
However, it can be recalled that a few weeks ago, some security concerns were expressed about Zoom’s video conferencing app. The communications technology firm has been trying to provide solutions to it, and reassure investors.
