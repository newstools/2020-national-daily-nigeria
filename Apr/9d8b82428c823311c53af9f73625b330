The Irigwe community of Bass Local Government Area of Plateau State, has decried the incessant killings hitherto being carried out by suspected Fulani herdsmen since the seat at home order by government as a result of the dread coronavirus pandemic.
The President, Irigwe Development Association, Hon. Sunday Abdu, made the claim on Monday through a press statement sent to our correspondent in Jos.
According to Mr. Abdu: “While our people have continued to remain indoors and law abiding in the wake of the national outcry over the coronavirus virus, the assailant Fulani herdsmen have continued each day within the last two weeks, to visit us with mayhem.
“On Wednesday, 1 April, Ancha, one of our troubled communities was visited once more in an attack that left three people dead and various houses razed. On Thursday 2 April, we woke up to bury six people burnt to death in HUkke from an overnight attack. Recently also, two young men were murdered in cold blood in nkyiedongwro while returning from molding bricks”, he said.
While also lamenting the brutal killings of his people, Abdu, also revealed that there was yet another killing of two mourners at kpenrie village on 23 March, and on the same day three children were also killed at Gbra zongu village.
“As we prepared this release today, 3rd April, the news came in that same nkyiedongwro suffered another night attack, such that there may be no house left unburnt”.
Our correspondent however reports that at about 7:10pm, 2 April 2020 some suspected Fulani militants stormed Hulke and Nkiedoro communities and set 23 houses ablaze.
According to an eyewitness, the attackers came in large numbers and began to set houses ablaze, killing their victims in the process.
Those who was killed in the attack were aged people who couldn’t escape the carnage. They were burnt in their homes beyond recognition.
