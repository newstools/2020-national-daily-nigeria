There have been indications of panic in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, after the mass attendance of the burial of the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari without precaution or conformity with the prevention measures being articulated by the Federal Government as guided by the National Centre for Disease Control and other global institutions.

The late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu, Abba Kyari,  died while receiving treatment for coronavirus having tested positive to the virus penultimate week.

Over 800 persons were identified to be in attendance at the burial of the late Chief of Staff.

Besides,  the handling of the corpse was grossly mismanaged. The frequent direct bodily contacts exposed many people to high risk who will have contacts with those fumbling with the corpse before the burial. The NCDC recruited unprofessional persons for the job.
Thousands of Abuja residents now live with the fear of infection.
