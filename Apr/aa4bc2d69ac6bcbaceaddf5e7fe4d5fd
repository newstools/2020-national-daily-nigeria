China would appear to be becoming frustrated with the business expectations of coronavirus as countries of the world adopt alternative methods of restriction of movement to spread of the virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has shown more commitment creating tension and panic around the world perhaps, to create business opportunities for China.
And becoming apprehensive of the absence of patronage, the customers are not stepping out, WHO official is threatening entering homes and forcing family members out for coronavirus test and treatment.
Dr. Michael Ryan, an Executive Director at the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, had on March 30 expressed perturbation that there something that he is not seeing much coverage of.
He remarked that: “in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that’s actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.”
He added that, “in some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units. Now, we need to go and look in families and find those people who may be sick and remove them, and isolate them, in a safe and dignified manner”.
Obviously, in Nigeria, there is low test on citizens and the figures of cases have been low but rising daily.  Nigeria like some other countries has been partially locked down. However, several other states which were not part of the federal government lockdown order have also commenced lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country.
However, Nigeria is importing medical facilities, including medical personnel from China to fight coronavirus in the country. So, China still has window of business patronage from Nigeria.
