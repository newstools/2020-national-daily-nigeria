Scott McTominay, Manchester United academy graduate has revealed that he looks up to the Old Trafford great, Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Scottish midfielder has revealed that his human inspiration when it comes to having an elite mentality is the man who graced Old Trafford for six seasons from 2003 to 2009.

The 23-year-old believes having the right mentality is the most important aspect of a successful career in the game.

“You look at Ronaldo and guys like this and their mentality is the top of the top and you don’t get any better than that,” he told the UTD podcast.

“For me, looking up to somebody like that, the physique he’s got, the way that he applies himself.

“I have just seen a picture of him two days ago reading and revising different things that he’s trying to learn in his life off the pitch. People are just far too comfortable too quickly in their life.”

Scott would love to be a Ronaldo’s clone.
