Nigerian musician Adekunle Gold has opened up to the world how his life wouldnt have been interesting if he had missed out on marrying Simi.

The ‘Orente’ crooner made the revelation in a thoughtful birthday post he penned to his wife Simi who marked his 32nd birthday on Sunday, April 19th 2020.

In the beautiful write up, Adekunle Gold made reference to the lines in of his hit songs ‘Orente’ which he dedicated to Simi 6 years where he used words like ‘Alobam’ and ‘One and Only.’

The loverman towards the end of the birthday message said that his life would suck if he never married Simi. In his words: ‘If you ended up with someone else, my life would totally suck,’ he wrote.

Adekunle and Simi met 6 years ago. The lovebirds got married in January 2019 and celebrated their one year anniversary in January 2020.

In a recent music video, ‘Duduke’ released by Simi on her birthday on Sunday, it could be seen that the singer’s babybump was put on display which means sooner than later, the couple will be welcoming their first child together.
