Former Super Eagles captain and  ex-Chelsea star John Mikel Obi was celebrated as he clocks 33 years on Wednesday, National Daily learnt.
The Stamford Bridge club took to their official Twitter page on Wednesday to post a picture of the former Super Eagles captain in action for the Blues.
Mikel, who is currently without a club after his contract with Trabzonspor, was terminated in March, joined Chelsea 14 years ago.

Also reacting, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) wrote on its official Twitter handle: “Former national team captain, 2013 Total AFCON winner, Three third-place medals.
“Happy Birthday to Nigeria’s retired midfielder, John Obi Mikel!”
In the same vein, The Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, wrote: “A big birthday shout out to former @NGSuperEagles captain and AFCON2013 winner, @mikel_john_ob. Thank you for the memories, and do have a good one.”
