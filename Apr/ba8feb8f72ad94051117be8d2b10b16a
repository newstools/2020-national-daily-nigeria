A statesman and Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, says the myriad of problems confronting the country can be traced to the military coup of 1966 which he said the north has been taken advantage of to dominate the other regions.
Pa Adebanjo who spoke during a special interview on the Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State (BCOS) TV, said as long as that constitution exists, leaders in the South who took part in the founding of this nation under its constitutional democracy will not accept,
“This constitution created local governments which they use to distribute resources. But the North is in a position of strength.
“This is a country where a section is imposing its will on the rest. They are using false population to get a majority in the parliament. The return to the genuine federal structure is imperative to free the rest of the country from servitude,” he said.
Speaking further, the Afenifere leader frowned that some Yoruba leaders in the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), had failed to be bold enough to condemn the current situation of things in the country. Our brothers who are in the APC will say they cannot do without the North and I dare say we are equal partners in this federation,” he added.
