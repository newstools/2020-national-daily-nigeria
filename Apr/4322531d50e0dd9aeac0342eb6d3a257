The Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says that lifting lockdown restrictions for COVID-19 is not the end of the pandemic. He said it will signal the beginning of a new phase.
Tedros told a virtual meeting of G20 health ministers that it’s vital in this next phase that countries educate, engage and empower their people to respond rapidly to any resurgence.
“We are encouraged that several G20 countries are now starting to plan how to ease social restrictions.
“It is critical that these measures are a phased process,” he said.
Tedros said WHO is deeply concerned that the virus now appears to be gathering pace in countries that lack the capacity of many G20 countries to respond to it.
“Urgent support is needed, not only to support countries to respond to COVID-19, but to ensure other essential health services continue,” he said.
Tedros also took the opportunity to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its support to the global fight against the virus.
Saudi Arabia announced Thursday a 500-million-U.S. dollar donation to relevant international organisations to support global efforts in combating the COVID-19.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us of a simple truth: we are one humanity. We share the same planet. We share the same hopes and dreams. We share the same destiny,” the WHO chief said
