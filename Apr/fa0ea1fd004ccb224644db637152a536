World Food Program, WFP, the U.N. food agency has warned that the world is “on the brink of a hunger pandemic,” as it struggles to contain COVID-19.
The WFP Executive Director David Beasley who disclosed this at the U.N. Security Council, said the world would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II in 2020.
“821 million people go to bed hungry every night all over the world, chronically hungry. And as Dr. Chu just pointed out as the new global report on food crises, that’s published today shows there are a further 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse.
“That means 135 million people on earth are marching toward the brink of starvation,” Beasley underlined.
As a result of COVID-19 an additional 130 million people “could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020, according to a World Food Program analysis.”
Beasley, who is recovering from COVID-19, warned that in a worst-case scenario “we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries.”
