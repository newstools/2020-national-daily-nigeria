This is not a jubilation moment for one of the world’s best football managers Pep Guardiola.

The Spaniard has lost his beloved mother  to the dreaded coronavirus pandemic that is presently ravaging the world..
Manchester City on Monday confirmed that Pep Guardiola’s mother, Dolors Sala Carrio, has passed away in Barcelona after contracting coronavirus.

Notably, the Premier League like other sporting events worldwide is currently suspended, due to the coronavirus crisis, with Guardiola himself recently donating £920,000 (€1million) to help provide medical equipment in Spain.
Guardiola’s homeland has remained one of the worst hit countries in Europe, with over 135,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19.
Though it has appeared to be past the outbreak’s peak after a fourth consecutive day in which the rate of deaths had fallen, but sadly, on Monday the English Premier League champions confirmed the distasteful news that Guardiola’s mother had died while extending their deepest sympathies.
A statement from the Etihad club read: ‘The Manchester City family are devastated to report the death today of Pep’s mother Dolors Sala Carrio in Manresa, Barcelona after contracting cornavirus.
She was 82 years old. ‘Everyone associated with the club sends their most heartfelt sympathy at this most distressing time to Pep, his family and all their friends.’
