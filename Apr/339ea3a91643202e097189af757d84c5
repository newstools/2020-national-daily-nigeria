Another son of the late poet and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa is dead in the UK.
Menegian died on Monday after being hospitalised following COVID-19 complications.
Noo Saro-Wiwa,  sister to Menegian, made this known on Thursday through a Facebook post.
According to her, her 50-year-old brother had underlying health conditions before contracting the virus.
“We said goodbye to my brother, Gian, on Monday. He had COVID-19 combined with underlying health conditions.
“Gian was the smartest and most talented out of all of us: a champion sprinter at school, a poet, an artist, budding engineer, a self-taught guitarist, and pianist. But mental health issues limited his life from age 16 onwards,” Noo wrote in a Facebook post.
She also described the father of one  as “a kind and beautiful soul, always wanting the best for his family, always praying for our future success while being eternally optimistic about his own. And, of course, always loved his music”.
In 2016, Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr., 47, died after a stroke in the UK, too
He was part of the administrations of ex-Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, the Late Umar Yar’ Adua, and Goodluck Jonathan.
