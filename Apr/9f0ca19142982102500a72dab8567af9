Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai isn’t getting mushy with his infection, and how long it is taking for him to recover.
He just told Nigerians to forget report claiming he is okay–even if they like to believe all things.
The governor, who chaired a meeting of the State Executive Council on Wednesday, described the reports as ‘fake news, adding that he still remains in self-isolation
“I have not been cleared of Covid-19 yet. I will personally announce when I am confirmed negative,” he said while chairing the state executive meeting from isolation on Wednesday, according to the Daily Trust.
“Please ignore all fake news even if they are what you wish for. I am grateful to our team led by the Deputy-Governor for keeping the agenda going without me.”
El-Rufai is the last of the three governors that got infected weeks ago.
Bachi Gov. Bala Mohammed and his PDP counterpart in Oyo, Seyi Makinde, have tested negative after some days in isolation.
