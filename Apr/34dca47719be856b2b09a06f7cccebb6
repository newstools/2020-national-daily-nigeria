Spain, one of the countries worst-affected by the coronavirus worldwide, reported on Saturday that a greater number of people had recovered from the virus than had been newly infected.
This was the case for the second consecutive day, the Health Ministry stated.
Officials said more than 3,500 COVID-19 sufferers had recovered from the respiratory disease caused by the virus during the past 24 hours, while there were 3,000 new infections.
At that time, 378 people had died.
These are almost half the level of infections and deaths seen at the height of the epidemic in Spain.
These latest figures bring the total number of infections to more than 220,000 in Spain with a death toll of nearly 23,000.
More than 95,000 people have recovered.
The country has been in a state of emergency since March 15 and this has been extended for the third time to run until May 9.
