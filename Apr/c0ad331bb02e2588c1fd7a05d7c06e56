The impact of the coronavirus pandemic – COVID 19 – on global economies is beginning to unfold.
Report of an investigation into the impact of COVID 19 on global economy coordinated by Henry Jackson Society, a British foreign policy think-tank, revealed that the G7, a group of countries controlling world’s largest economies, lost £3.2 trillion to the coronavirus pandemic. The Report concluded that the loss could have been averted if the Chinese Communist Party (CPP) was transparent, sincere and honest on information about the outbreak of COVID 19 in December 2019. The investigation indicated that China’s concealment of authentic information on the pandemic breached international healthcare treaty responsibilities which China is signatory to. The Report which will be published on Monday noted that misinformation by China on the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, Mainland China, made countries of the world unprepared to contain the spread. It pointed out that countries could not make effective preventive decisions until the exportation of the virus to virtually all the countries of the world.
According to the report of the investigation, “there is evidence that China directly breached international healthcare treaty responsibilities.” The report further recommended 10 legal processes countries that suffered damages from the coronavirus pandemic could use to seek compensation from China.
