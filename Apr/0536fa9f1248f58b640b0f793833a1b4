The World Health Organization (WHO) is covertly shifting emphasis from the dreaded coronavirus pandemic to malaria epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, warning of high malaria deaths in the year 2020.
WHO remarked that preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus could worsen the needed medical facilities to treat malaria, noting that the coronavirus pandemic could increases malaria deaths sub-Saharan Africa.
The closure of borders and travel bans in containing COVID-19 were identified as impediments to the supply of medicines and insecticide-treated nets required to prevent malaria.
WHO expressed the fear that such obstruction could erase the success made in malaria control and restore the malaria mortality rate experienced 20 years ago.
In 400,000 annual malaria deaths, 90 per cent is attributed to the African continent.
WHO in its current review observed that about 760,000 people may die malaria caused by mosquito bite in Africa.
Meanwhile, WHO has not been able to help African countries find solutions to the deadly coronavirus ravaging the continent and other parts of the world. The shifting of emphasis, therefore, raises suspicion, or may be diversionary to the reality of coronavirus.
