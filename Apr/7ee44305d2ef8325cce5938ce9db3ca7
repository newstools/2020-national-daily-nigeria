The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has directed that Private Guard Operatives in Nigeria must henceforth wear personal identification on their uniform.
The NSCDC Commandant General, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu, in response to the arrest of some fake Private Guard Operatives during the Covid-19 lockdown at beats and locations across the country, ordered that all State Commandants of the Corps should ensure and enforce the recent directive that all Private Guards in the country should sew their Private Security Identification (PSID) number on their uniform.
The CG explained that the number should tally with the service numbers generated during the Biometrics Data Capturing of guards.
He indicated that the Corps is collaborating with sister agencies like the DSS, the NPF, NIA, and the Corps supervisory ministry (Ministry of Interior) which the NSCDC has already shared this data with to arrest all erring operatives.
The NSCDC added that the introduction of name tags had become necessary to ensure the safety of lives and properties of Nigerians and protect the integrity of the duly registered Private Guards Companies.
With the vital information on the uniform which includes Private Security Identification (PSID), any operative involved in crime can easily be identified and apprehended, the NSCDC warned.
