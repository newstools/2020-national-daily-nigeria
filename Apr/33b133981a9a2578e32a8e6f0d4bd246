Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has disclosed new confirmed Covid-19 cases on his Twitter handle on Sunday.
According to him, one of the three new cases is a suspect arrested and arraigned over the killing of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of the leader of the Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti.
“The Commissioner of Police has been duly informed and the line tracing of police officers and others in the SARS facility, where he was kept has started and their specimens are being collected.
“The suspect has been isolated from others and will be moved to the IDH for treatment. The commissioner of Police has assured the state that there will be adequate security around the IDH premises to prevent his escape and while on treatment, he will be manacled to the bed.”
The governor promised more details during the daily presser later.
The suspect was among the four remanded in prison by a magistrate court during the week, when they were to be tested before throwing them in jail.
