The federal government of Nigeria has annouced May 4, 2020 (Monday) for all University and Polytechnic in Nigeria to resume, tentatively.

All things been equal, based on whatever happens in the battle against covid-19, in about a month’s time, schools shall resume.

We may recall that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Mr Sonny Echono on behalf of the Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, directed all 104 Unity Schools in the country should close on or before the 26th of March, 2020 for a month then, as a proactive measure to prevent the spread of the pandemic Coronavirus.

According to the authority, it’s been a hard decision, but it’s one of the way to reduce the spread as well as to prevent the student and staff from the virus. So in that development, students and pupils were advised to stay off unnecessary gathering for the main time.

So all University and Polytechnic schools will tentatively, resume on Monday, May 4, 2020.
