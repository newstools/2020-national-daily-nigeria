As a way of curbing the spread of the deadly coronavirus in the country, the UK government has imposed a 14-day quarantine for all foreign citizens and returning citizens arriving the country.
The measure is in line with “phase two” of government’s efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.
According to Daily Mail, UK officials have been asked to ensure compliance by imposing fines or prosecuting defaulters under the coronavirus act.
There have been concerns that the failure to limit arrivals and check passengers has made a mockery of the lockdown.
Under the plan, the authorities could visit addresses of all those who have returned to the country to ensure that they were not breaking their quarantine.
The country’s immigration have also been empowered to remove a potentially infectious person to a suitable place for screening and assessment.
Daily Mail quoted a source as saying that the government is considering stricter measures to reduce the possibility “of a second peak”.
“A stringent, Singapore-style approach at our ports will help the UK manage the risk from travellers entering the country and reduce the possibility of a second peak,” the source was quoted as saying.
“We are looking at deploying these measures at the right time, in line with the scientific advice and when community transmission has been significantly reduced.”
So far, UK has recorded 148,377 cases of COVID-19, with 20,319 dying from the disease.
