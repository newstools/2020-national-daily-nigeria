Super Eagles Team Coordinator Patrick Pascal has called for immediate arrest of former Super Eagles handlers Bonfere Jo and Clemens Westerhoff over US 94′ World Cup match-fixing claims.
Bonfrere Jo, who assisted Westerhof during Nigerian soccer team’s US 94 World Cup campaigns had claimed in a recent interview that Westerhof collected $100,000 to lose a World cup game involving Nigeria and Italy.
Pascal said the government must call the two tacticians for questioning as the allegation is a serious one.
The former Shooting Stars Sports Club of Ibadan striker said this while featuring live on the BCOS Sports programme, Fans Forum anchored by Boluwaji Ogunmola and produced by Adewale Tijani.
“This is a serious allegation, Bonfere should be called to come and explain, because you cannot sell a country and escape punishment. If he said it live on a radio show, Nigeria Government should arrest him (Bonfere Jo) and Westerhoff wherever he is.
Westerhoff must come to explain why he betrayed Nigeria, why did you do that? Bonfrere must give evidences to back up his allegation. If we do not arrest those people, it means we don’t know what we are doing that’s match fixings”.
The 79-year-old Dutchman alongside his compatriot led the country’s senior national team to their maiden global football showpiece appearance in 1994, months after leading them to Africa Cup of Nations glory.
Bonfere Jo has since issued a disclaimer regarding US 94′ World Cup match-fixing claims.
