The spokesman of the Ogun state Police Command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, has debunked a trending video which insinuated that a Chinese company in Ibese area of the state had forcefully locked in its Nigerian workers.
In the video now making the rounds on social media, the workers were said to have gone on rampage because they were hungry and have been forcefully locked in by the company’s authority.
Some of the protesters were heard saying “no more management. This management should have sorted this since yesterday, pay us at least two month salary.”
It also appeared the protesters were destroying some parts of the company’s facility.
However, Oyeyemi said it was an issue between the company and its workers, and not a case of angry youths going about to destroy Chinese facilities as the video is being portrayed in some quarters.
What happened is a dispute between the workers and the management of that company,” he said.
“The workers said since the lockdown started, the management of the company did not allow them to go out of the company; that they locked them inside. So that was what sparked the protest.
“It was the workers that were having problem with the management and it has been resolved. The incident happened three days ago. It is not as if members of the public are attacking the company, no.”
As a part of measures to stop the spread of COVID-19, President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a two-week extension of the lockdown in the federal capital territory (FCT), Lagos and Ogun states.
