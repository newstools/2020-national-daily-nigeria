The son of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar who tested positive for coronavirus claims he is doing fine, and hopes to get out of quarantine soon.
Mohammed Atiku, in a video from isolation said though he was actually traumatised being the first recorded case in Abuja, and that the fake news that greeted his confirmation didn’t help.
“On the 20th of (March), I tested positive for COVID-19 and I was brought over to the Isolation Centre at Gwagwalada University Teaching Hospital where I have been since,” he said in Twitter video his father Atiku Abubakar shared on Thursday.
“I am currently on my 12th day here and I hope to be out soon – perhaps when my next test is taken and the results are favourable. I should be on my way out, hopefully.
“I decided to do this video so that I could speak about my experience to be of help to Nigerians.
“I was asymptomatic in my first few days here and nervous; I had a level of anxiety and a little bit of trauma, especially being the index case here in Abuja. That was really the main challenge.
“But day by day, I grew stronger, thanks largely to all the goodwill and prayers and support I got from a vast array of Nigerians many of whom I don’t know. My family and friends too and a whole lot of people.
“I thank God I am well and good.”
Like other positive cases who have recovered, Mohammed encouraged Nigerians to shelve religion and ethnicity in the fight against Covid-19.
