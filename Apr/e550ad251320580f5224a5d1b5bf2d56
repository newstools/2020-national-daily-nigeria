The breakfast coronavirus intervention scheme of the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has attracted N10 million donation from other prominent stakeholders in the state.
The donors said they were encouraged by the Speakerâ€™s personal assistance to the people at a time of economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The donors include Lagos businessman, Adebiyi Olalekan, who contributed N5 million, and another businessman, Taiwo Elegbede, who donated N200,000.
Other donors include Sunday Babatunde, N1 million, Hon. Nureni Akinsoya and Afolabi who contributed N300,000 and N200,000, respectively.
Hon. Rotimi Olowo, Gbolahan Yishawu and the Chairman of Agege Local Government Area, Ganiyu Egunjobi, supported the scheme with N1 million donation each while Hon. Fatai Mojeed contributed N300,000.
Obasa, who had shared 10,000 re-packaged rice at the beginning of lockdown in Lagos State to contain the spread of COVID-19, started the breakfast intervention scheme with the distribution of 26,000 loafs of bread around the Agege area.
Meanwhile, residents of neighbouring Local Government Areas as well as Local Council Development Areas (LCDA) have called on the Speaker to extend the gesture to their areas.
The residents said the plea follows their understanding that Obasa is not just the Speaker of his constituency or Agege area, but the entire Lagos.
