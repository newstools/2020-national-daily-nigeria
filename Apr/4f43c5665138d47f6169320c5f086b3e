Madagascar last Thursday recorded high demand for COVID-Organics, as citizens rush for collection  of the local herbal syrup for prevention and remedy of coronavirus.

President Andry Rajoelina had unveiled the COVID-19 Organics early last week; he said that that the Organic had cured two patients. The President’ revealed that the Organic will be distributed free to citizens, including all school going children. Schools reopened last Wednesday in Madagascar.
The President’ had declared: “All trials and tests have been conducted and its effectiveness in reducing the elimination of symptoms has been proven for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in Madagascar.”
The Madagascar President also revealed the Senegal has also demanded for supply of the Covid Organics from Madagascar.
It was disclosed that there was long  queue of citizens who were collectng the Organics  from officials wearing protective mask and gloves.
However,  as expected, the usual agitation of orthodox medicine practitioners against traditional medicine has started against the COVID-19 Organics discovered in Madagascar.  Scientists have argued  that there is currently no cure for the virus, expressing doubt over the efficacy of the Organics to cure coronavirus.  However, President Rajoelina  insisted it’s an African discovery, reiterating that a fellow African president has since commended Madagascar for the breakthrough.
The President’ declared in a post on twitter: “Excellent discussion with President Tshisekedi of DRC who congratulates us on the improved traditional Covid-Organics remedy.
“Africa is united and develops solutions against COVID-19 thanks to its natural heritage. The Malagasy are by the side of their brothers.”
