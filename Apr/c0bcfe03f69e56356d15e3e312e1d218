Osinachi Joseph (née Kalu), known professionally as Sinach, has a message for her fans this season. The Nigerian singer, songwriter and senior worship leader at Loveworld sent her fans and christians all over the world an open letter:

“Happy Easter my dear friend, Jesus is alive and now the life of God in us is made possible.

“This is an unprecedented time in our history. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many lives, businesses around the world and healthcare systems in many cities.

“As we all continue to navigate through these evolving events, we must keep our faith and dispel fear. As God’s own we are certain of the protective assurance in the Word of God and We must learn to meditate more on His Word at this time.

“There is no need to fear my friend, In Psalm 91 vs 1-13, the scripture gives us a clear understanding of what our disposition should be like. Most importantly declare with authority The Name of Jesus over your homes, city, over the medical personnel and essential workforces in your nations.

“Find for yourselves songs and scriptures that will inspire your faith and guarantee peace in your heart. Click on these links below for my new single and some of my recommendations for you”.

Sinach has released several gospel hit songs, including “Way Maker”, “I Know Who I Am”, “Great Are You Lord”, “Rejoice”, “He Did It Again”, “Precious Jesus”, “The Name of Jesus”, “This Is My Season”, “Awesome God”, “For This”, “I Stand Amazed”, “Simply Devoted” and “Jesus is Alive”. Sinach received a Bethlehem Hall of Faith certificate of commemoration during her visit to Israel in December 2017.
