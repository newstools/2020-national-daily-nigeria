It’s common knowledge that Aki and Pawpaw whose real names are Chinedu Ikedieze and Osita Iheme respectively, both entered the movie industry at the same time and it’s their partnership that gained them their present status in Nollywood.

Apparently, Aki and Pawpaw parted way as we stopped seeing them in movies together and they stopped living together; there was really no beef between them.

 Chinedu Ikedieze (Aki) explains as he speaks to the press, “there was no clash between us. Then, the owner of the property wanted to use it, so we both had to vacate the apartment. The truth must be told, we cannot live together forever. We are adults and someday we would get married. We are not some twins, I am from Abia and he is from Imo. It’s just that we are good friends. It is not bad we go our separate ways, though; we are not far from each other’.

And true both are separately living independently now with their own women.

And although the superstar twins, Peter and Paul Okeye also separated and went each separate ways. They however did their’s in bad blood with a fight on tape still trending on YouTube even unto this day.
