The theory that Antoine Griezmann and Lionel Messi don’t pass to each other was disproved on Saturday against Getafe.

Messi and Griezmann combined brilliantly as the Frenchman opened the scoring for Barcelona at the Camp Nou.

It was a vital goal too, with Getafe growing into the game at that moment.

That was also Griezmann’s first league goal since Quique Setien replaced Ernesto Valverde in the Camp Nou dugout, though he had scored three times in the Copa del Rey before Barcelona were knocked out by Athletic Club – twice against Ibiza and once against Leganes.

Griezmann is developing a knack for opening the scoring as well, with this being the ninth time this season he’s scored Barcelona’s first goal.

One man who is struggling to find the net at present is Messi, who has now gone 375 minutes without a goal in LaLiga Santander.

This is even more bizarre considering the likes of Ansu Fati, Sergio Busquets, Frenkie de Jong and Clement Lenglet have all netted in that time.

Setien will be pleased Messi and Griezmann seem to be getting along, and Griezmann thinks their relationship will keep improving.

“I’ve been here for six months and we still have to learn each other’s movements,” the former Atletico Madrid forward said after the Getafe victory.

“It will get better. We’re enjoying working together.

“Getafe are a difficult team. If you’re ahead, it’s because of something [you’ve done well].

“We wanted to stay calm and bring the ball out well. It was very difficult for us, we suffered, but sometimes it’s good to suffer.”
