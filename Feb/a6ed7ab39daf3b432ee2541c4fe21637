The Remo Stars player allegedly killed by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Kazeem Tiyamyu, has finally been laid to rest in his town.
Kazeem Tiyamiyu was killed during a faceoff with SARS officials last Saturday, February 22nd.
He was reportedly picked up by SARS officials on his way home from training with a colleague. He was accused of being an internet Fraudster (Yahoo boy).
Tiamiyu reportedly identified himself as a footballer as the SARS operatives were taking him to their office in Abeokuta and he was allegedly pushed out from the SARS vehicle by the officers.
An oncoming vehicle crushed him to death on the Sagamu-Abeokuta Expressway.
A police statement initially claimed the footballer jumped out of the vehicle in an attempt to escape and was crushed by an oncoming vehicle.
However, Sanni Abubakar, a friend, and teammate of Kazeem, who was also arrested by the SARS officials, said the SARS officials pushed Tiamiyu out of their Toyota Sienna vehicle before he was killed by an oncoming vehicle.
A candlelight session was held in his honor on Wednesday and finally laid to rest on Thursday with family and friends including teammates present to honor him.
