Olamide Baddo just got signed to an international record deal Empire Records for a joint venture deal recently. Now the question is what exactly prompted this movement? The answer to this is not yet clear but it can be assumed that he’s doing this to get back his place from the self acclaimed African Giant popularly known as Burna boy.

Burna boy got into the international scene for his recent album named “African Giant” which was highly accepted globally. This album got Burna’s music life revived and taken to a higher level by winning almost all prestigious awards from the headies man of the year to MTV and internationally BET and also a Grammy nomination.

This is actually a great achievement for him. Now the generally accepted king of the street (Olamide Baddo) is back on another level as well taking his music to the international stage. He’s about to get back his place as the third rated artist after Wizkid and Davido.Denying burna boy that place won’t be an easy task though as he’s not gonna stop anytime soon.

He’s also claimed himself to be the best after the legendary Afrobeats icon Fela Kuti. This was not widely accepted by fans anyways. People rejected his claim and proved other artistes like Starboy Wizzy,Davido,2baba,Dbanj and the kutis (Femi and Seun Kuti) as the best artistes after Fela.

Right now Olamide is about to include his own name to those names mentioned recently. Let’s hope to see how it goes with the voice of the street “Baddosneh”.
