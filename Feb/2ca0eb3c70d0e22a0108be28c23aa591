A Lokoja High Court on Thursday nullifies the candidature of the governorship candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Engr. Musa Wada, in the last governorship election in the state held on 3rd of September, 2019.
It would be recalled that Engr. Musa Wada emerged the candidate of the PDP for the Governorship election held on 16 November, 2019.
Not satisfied with the outcome, an aspirant in the party’s Primary, Alhaji Abubakar Idris challenged the victory of Engr Wada.
Alh. Abubakar Ibrahim who came second in that primary through his counsel said he won the PDP primaries, alleging the smuggling in of 600 and another missing 241 votes to favor the PDP flag bearer.
But Justice John Olorunfemi while looking at the evidence brought before him by the plaintiff and the defendant ruled that the PDP primary was hasty and inconclusive.
He faulted the PDP Governorship Primaries held on 3rd September 2019, insisting that the party had no candidate in 2019 Guber poll.
