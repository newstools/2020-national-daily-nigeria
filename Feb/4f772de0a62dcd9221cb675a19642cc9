Terrorists undergoing de-radicalization, rehab, and re-integration under the military might be heading for something more exciting s Senate introduces  bill to create an agency for the so-called repentant criminals.
Last month, the Nigerian military said no fewer than 608 repentant Boko Haram insurgents were undergoing the DRR) programme under its Operation Safe Corridor in Malam-Sidi, Gombe State.
The repentant terrorists were said to have been exposed to formal literacy classes, skills acquisition and Islamic Religious Knowledge (IRK) as well as drug and psycho-therapists during their training.
But a group of Borno elders, led by ex-governor Kashim Shettima, last year, frowned at the programme, describing it as  not well thought out.
They feared that releasing the purported repentant Boko Haram militants into civilian population could be counterproductive as hardened fighters would return to the terror group to commit more atrocities.
“The ongoing de-radicalization and reintegration of repentant Boko Haram insurgents under the “operation safe corridor” of the defense headquarters is a course for concern for members of the Civilian JTF and some stakeholders in the State,” the group wrote in a letter last year.
“(We) suspect that “Boko Haram members do not repent” hence the de-radicalization programme may be breeding spies and agents of recruitment for the Boko Haram,” they had said.
They urged the president to approve the suspension of the programme.
A bill, sponsored by Ibrahim Gaidam of Yobe East senatorial district, read for the first time on the floor of the Senate Thursday, proposes a new agency for that, and offers further concession to Boko Haram militants who choose to cease fire.
