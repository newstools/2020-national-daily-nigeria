Women  Football Advocate,Moses Bako  told National Daily that he want to passionately appeal to all the females stakeholders to look beyond personal interest so as to move it forward .
He said that after a successful AGM/Congress in Benin and plans and visions for the year 2020 was rolled, he think we should all embrace the wind of progress and join in promoting it.
The Female Football Advocate explained that the club owners had an election which was also successful with the emergence of Matilda Otuene Onyiloha as Chairman.
I want to therefore appeal to the new excos to work together with the women league board for the progress of the league.
He all revealed that  the Club owners should embrace peace, walk together in unity as divisions will not in anyway help the progress of women football.
He added that Club owners should as a matter of fact come together to compliment the efforts of the board, come out with, views, ideas and suggestions that will move women football forward.
To the advocates of women football, be guided by your advocacy believe for progress. Make a change for good,  Individually and collectively. Have it at the back of your minds that women football can always be better than this.
We  thank God for the huge media support for women’s football. In my advocacy work for women football, I turned into a “by force” journalist all in d quest to promote women football in Nigeria as there were few journalists talking about it. But today its history. So many are in it and more are coming ..please continue to promote women football. Continue to report more of the positives.
Bako concluded that the actors i mean the players should be disciplined, create a brand for themselves, because someone will come and watch a game for your sake.
