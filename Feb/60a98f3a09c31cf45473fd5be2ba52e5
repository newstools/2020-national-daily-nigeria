The collision of two light planes midair on Wednesday left all passengers on board dead. The casualty was, however, said to be relatively less frightening as the two planes were conveying four persons all of whom were killed in the mid-air collision. They were not commercial flights that carry passengers in hundreds.
Report indicated that the debris of the planes was scattered across a rural area north of Melbourne, Australia, where the air crash occurred.
It was gathered that Police narrated that the two twin-engined aircraft were each carrying a pilot and a passenger when they crashed around 4,000 feet (1,200) above the town of Mangalore.

Images from the crash scene on the ground showed twisted metal and chunks of fuselage scattered in a field and among trees.
Police said both planes were flying legally in the area but investigations were ongoing.
“We’re not sure why both aircraft were exactly on the same trajectory or why they were in that area but unfortunately they have collided mid-air,” Police Inspector Peter Koger said.
One aircraft had just taken off from the nearby airfield, but the other plane’s origin was still unclear, he added.
