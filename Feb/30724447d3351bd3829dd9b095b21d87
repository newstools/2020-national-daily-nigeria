“The party recalled that even when others remained in the deflated and defunct Allied People’s Movement (APM),  Yinka Mafe took a very bold and courageous step to return to APC”.

“While the other  defected and defeated members of  defunct APM were still shadow-chasing and  preoccupied with empty boasts, Mafe, less than a month after the election of Prince Dapo Abiodun, specifically on April 2, 2019 announced his return to APC on the floor of Ogun State House of Assembly.”

“While commiserating with the wife, children and the entire members of the family of the deceased,  and indeed the people of Sagamu 1 State Constituency, the APC prays that God will give them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
