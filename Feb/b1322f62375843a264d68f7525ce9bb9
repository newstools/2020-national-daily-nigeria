The executive chairman of Ifako-Ijaiye Council Area of Lagos State, Apostle Oloruntoba Oke, on Monday, resumed full official duties following amicable resolution of issues that led to his brief exit as directed by the Lagos State House of Assembly, late November, 2019.
Oke, who was warmly welcomed by the council vice chairman, Hon. Usman Hamzat,  the Secretary to the LG, Pastor Ayo Jeje; the council Manager, Mr. Adewunmi Ogunbambi and other top officials of the council, was elated by the tumultuous cheers of staff and party faithful that witnessed the occasion.
Meanwhile, the council boss, who met with members of the Exco and Management behind closed  doors  for few hours, was later conducted round the offices by top officials of the council within the Aina-Ajobo  Headquarters of the local government.
The unassuming council boss was all smiles, as he regains his top seat at the local government area office.

Some party faithful,who reacted on his reinstatement notes that Toba’s case remains a lesson to many,stating that though he is a good administrator yet the unexpected can happen,so Public office holders need be wary of this.
