The victim of unfortunate judgement of the Supreme Court and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State, David Lyon, has dissociated himself from the violent uprising and mass protests within and outside Bayelsa State over the nullification of his victory by the court. Lyon complained that mischief-makers been have using the opportunity of his silence to perpetrate all kinds of violence and civil unrest in Bayelsa State.
Lyon in a statement on Wednesday indicated that he would not support or be engaged in any act of violence because of the judgement of the Supreme Court.
 “As a law-abiding citizen of Nigeria, I would never support or direct anyone to be engaged in acts inimical to the progress and wellbeing of the same people I seek to govern.
“Some mischief-makers have seized on the opportunity of my silence to perpetrate all kinds of evil intentions and actions in the guise of expressing their grievances and have created unnecessary and avoidable circumstances in the political history of our state and country,” he declared.

Lyon reiterated strong belief that the court is the last hope of the common man. He said that since the judgement, he has been more occupied with exploring all legal processes in addressing the issue.
Lyon, therefore, called on all political leaders irrespective of party affiliations to call their teaming supporters to be calm and law-abiding and never take laws into their hands.
Lyon, reaffirming his faith and confidence in the judiciary and the Supreme Court, in particular, expressed the optimism that, “at the end of the day, justice will be done to himself and the good people of Bayelsa State.”
