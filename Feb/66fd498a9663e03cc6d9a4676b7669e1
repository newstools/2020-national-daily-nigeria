The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, in his usual unguarded utterances, dared the Supreme Court of Nigeria on its judgment in which the court annulled APC’s victory in the governorship election in Bayelsa State, vowing that no governor will be sworn in on Friday in Bayelsa.
 
Oshiomhole at a media briefing in Abuja on Thursday, said that the Supreme Court judgment lacks the fruit of justice.
The APC chairman had declared that by the apex court’s judgment, no one will be sworn in as governor in Bayelsa on Friday, arguing that aside from the candidate of the APC, David Lyon, no other candidate has the constitutional spread to be sworn in as governor. “Our lawyers are already studying the judgment to take the necessary legal action,” Oshiomhole stated.
There are strong indications that Oshiomhole may be testing the troubled waters in Bayelsa State.
