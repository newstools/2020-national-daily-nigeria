The ambition of former Lagos governor Bola Tinubu and Kaduna governor, Nasir El-Rufa’i, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 has been confirmed in a way.
Yobe Gov. Mala Buni said it will not cause a rift in the All Progressives Congress (APC)..
“It will further strengthen the party, this is because Buhari has laid a solid foundation in the party through his good governance,” he said in BBC Hausa service interview on Saturday
Buni, however, opposed the clamor for power shift, noting that such would limit choices available to the electorate
“It was not even in an established order,” the government insisted.
On insurgency, he lamented that some children in Yobe and Borno had been out of school for ten years due to the Boko Haram crisis.
