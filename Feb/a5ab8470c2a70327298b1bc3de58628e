Three key players of Barclay Premiership leader side, Liverpool will not be among players that will file out today against West Ham United in tonight’s Premier League fixture at Anfield due to injury.
Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, named the three players as Jordan Henderson, Xherdan Shaqiri, and Nathaniel Clyne during his pre-match press conference over the weekend.
According to him, Henderson is yet to recover after the midfielder sustained a hamstring injury during their Champions League 1-0 defeat against Atletico Madrid last week. At the same time, Shaqiri and Clyne are still recovering from a long-term injury.

“The good news is that we still have options in the midfield after Henderson’s injury against Atletico,” Klopp was quoted by Liverpool’s official website as saying.
“He will not take part against West Ham on Monday.”
He added: “Apart from Henderson, Shaqiri, and Clyne, all the other boys are fit.
“We will see who will start, and maybe we will make more changes – but not because of the Atletico match.”
