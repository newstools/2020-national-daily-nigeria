A Coalition of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) has berated the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over reckless impunity and disregard for democratic values and electoral principles. The CSOs emphasized that bad leadership created political liability and electoral misfortunes for the APC in the 2019 general elections and thereafter. They argued that the APC should not be allowed to transfer the liabilities of the party’s bad leadership to Nigeria’s public institutions.
The CSOs, therefore, demanded the Supreme Court not to reverse its judgement on the Zamfara State governorship election. The group insisted that the court should maintain status quo on the judgment it earlier delivered on  May 24, 2019 in Zamfara State and should not grant the relief sought by the APC.
The CSOs contended that  any form of review on the Zamfara State election would send bad signal to the people who are presently satisfied with the governance of the State.
APC and former Governor Abdulazeez Yari had returned to the Supreme Court seek the reversal of the judgment on the governorship election in which the court insisted that APC had no candidates in Zamfara State.
The APC approached the Supreme Court to vacate the consequential order in conjunction with the judgment of 24th May 2019,
The CSOs, however, maintained that  the Supreme Court should disregard the prayers of the APC, and uphold the judgement it earlier delivered in the interest of the people in Zamfara as well as to encourage the development of democracy in the country.
