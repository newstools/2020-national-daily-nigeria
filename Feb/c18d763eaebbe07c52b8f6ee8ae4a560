Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State may be on the path to commit class suicide in northern Nigeria. The Kano Governor is subtly laying the foundation for dissolving the aristocracy in the north and expanding the scope of freedom for greater population of citizens in Kano State. Accordingly, the Kano State Government banned Almajiri children from street begging, insisting on consolidation of the free and compulsory primary and secondary schools education policy in the state.
Governor Ganduje at the launch of Basic Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) and the Distribution of Offer of Appointment to 7,500 volunteer teachers, at Sani Abacha Stadium, Kofar Mata, on Tuesday, decried the incessant social menace in the state and other parts of the north; cautioning that parents and/or guardians of the children would be taken to court for disrespecting the laws on child rights.

Governor Ganduje opened opportunities for overarching human capital development as well as socializing the residents of Kano State into modern civilization beyond Islamic injunctions.
Governor Ganduje declared: “This policy of free and compulsory basic and secondary education goes along with the integration of our Almajiri system into the mainstream policy implementation; which suggests that English and Arithmetic must be included in the Almajiri School’s curriculum.
“While they will continue acquiring their study of the Holy Qur’an, they would at the same time, learn English and Arithmetic, which will give them an opportunity to continue with their studies to secondary schools and beyond.
“It is not only that the beggar is caught, his parents and/or guardians. Such parents or guardians would be taken to court for disrespecting our laws.”
