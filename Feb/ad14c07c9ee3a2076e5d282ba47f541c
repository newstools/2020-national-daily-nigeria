The Lagos State Government has made exemptions to the motorcycle and tricycle ban being enforced though it insists it is not going to review the policy, despite public outcry on the ripple effects of the decision.
According to the state commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, dispatch riders, courier companies, newspaper dispatching motorcycle, and motorbike riders, are exempted from the ban.
He also explained the discretionary power of the enforcement agents.
“Every officer to enforce this law has discretionary powers to arrest,” he said.
There have been slight protests in the state after the ban took effect on Saturday.
But Omotosho said the government is not planning to review the ban.
