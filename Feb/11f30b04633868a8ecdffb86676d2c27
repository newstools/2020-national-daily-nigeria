The RCCG General Overseer Pastor Enoch Adeboye on Sunday led a protest  against the insecurity situation across the country.
Adeboye and the protesting church members started the march at about 11am shortly after the church service at RCCG’s National Headquarters in Ebute Metta, Lagos State.
The protest was particularly against the constant killing of Christians in the North and other parts of the country.


Boko Haram a few weeks ago beheaded Revd Lawan Andimi, the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria in Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State.

Reacting to Andimi’s execution the Christian Association of Nigeria accused  President  Buhari’s administration of standing pat while  Boko Haram  kills Christians.



The Christian Association of Nigeria had declared a three-day fasting and prayer beginning January 31st to strengthen the government and the military forces in the fight against insecurity.

CAN President, Dr Samson Ayokunle said the spiritual exercise would end today February 2 with a prayer walk.
