Founder and General Overseer of Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo has insisted there are people who sponsored the bomber arrested inside one of its Kaduna branches  on Sunday.
The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Sabo had confirmed that the suspect named Nathaniel Samuel was a Christian from Bauchi State.


According to Sabo, the suspect was arrested inside the church with a bag containing items suspected to be Improvised Explosive Devices (IED)

Speaking on Monday at the Church’s Covenant hour of prayer, Oyedepo said It’s impossible for the killer and others like him to be on the loose without some authorities backing them up.



”Everyone in government, everyone in security services, that is behind these killings: YOUR END HAS COME.” he said as he prayed during the church’s programme Monday morning



The cleric who boasted that God confirmed his prayers said woe to anyone involved or connected with the callous killings in the country.





According to him, the generation of members of Boko Haram, Miyetti Allah is cursed.

”The most irresponsible, most murderous system, is what we have today and in the name of Jesus by the Apostolic authority upon my life and Prophetic seal on my forehead, your end has come.”



He noted that many precious lives have been wasted in the last two weeks and in the name of Jesus, the generations of those involved is declared wasted.

Last Sunday, his counterpart , the General Overseer  of the RCCG, Pastor E.A Adeboye led the church members at his headquarters branch in Lagos on a rally, in protest against killing by terrorists.

Adeboye said every life lost, Christian or Muslim, is precious before God.
