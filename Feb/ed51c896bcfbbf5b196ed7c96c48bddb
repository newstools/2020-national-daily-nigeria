For taking the APC brief to challenge the Supreme Court ruling that upturned the victory of the APC guber candidate David Lyon, SANs Afe Babalola (and Wole Olanipekun (SAN) have incurred a N30-million fine each.
Whie reading the judgement, Justice Amina Augie announced the fine amidtst tears, wondering why very senior lawyers would take up such briefs.
The court awarded the costs of N10m to be personally paid by David Lyon’s lawyer,  Babalola , and APC’s lawyer, Olanipekun.
It ruled that each of the lawyers must pay the N10m to each of the three respondents – the Peoples Democratic Party, Governor Duoye Diri, and the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Lawrence Ewhruojakpo, bringing the total amount to be paid to N60 million.
According to her,  the application amounted to an invitation for the apex court to sit in appeal on its own judgment in violation of the Constitution.
She said granting the applications would open a floodgate for the review of decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There must be an end to litigation,” she said, adding, “the decision of the Supreme Court is final for ages in a matter” and only legislation could change it
The seven-man panel of the apex court led by Justice Sylvester Ngwuta described the applications filed by the APC and its governorship candidate as vexatious, frivolous, and a gross abuse of court process.
