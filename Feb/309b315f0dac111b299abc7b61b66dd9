Abuja based Warri comedian, Peter Ogbudu with stage name as Ghana Must Go is at it again. This time he is joking about another serious matter. According to the Vintage Comedy show host, many Niverian Civil servants have made the court their second home. So they can falsify and reduce their age.

He said many 80years old civil servants are reducing their ages to 56years so they can avoid retirement. This is alarming and as the comedian rightly said it will affect the youths. As the youths will not be able to get their turns working as civil servants if the old people refuse to evacuate.

He cracked everyone’s ribs online, when he said he was reporting their case to a marmaid because the perpetrators don’t fear God. He made the speech beside a river.
