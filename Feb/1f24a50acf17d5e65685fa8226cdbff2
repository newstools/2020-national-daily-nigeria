The campaign against sexual harassment and abuse in Ekiti has claimed its first casualties as three teachers of two secondary schools were arrested by the officers of the Ekiti State Police Command on Tuesday.
This is coming barely twenty four hours after the State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Wale Fapohunda, raised the alarm that teachers in some secondary schools in the state were taking undue advantage of their underage female students.
According to the spokesman of the Command, Sunday Abutu, the incidents which occurred at different locations were reported to the police by a concerned citizen through a petition.
Newsmen gathered that the teachers lured the teenage students into remote locations where they serially had carnal knowledge of the underage girls.
Another case of sexual assault has also been reported from Ijan Ekiti in Gboyin Local government area, as a former teacher was said to have turned a student to sex slave and even went as far as registering the girl for family planning so as to prevent pregnancy.
The police spokesperson explained that investigation has been launched into the matter adding that the culprits would be prosecuted after due interrogation.
One of the teachers arrested is from Osi Grammar School while two others are from All Souls Grammar School in Ado Ekiti.
