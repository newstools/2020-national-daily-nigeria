Actress Eniola Badmus has volunteered to be used as an experiment by manufacturers of weight loss products.

The plus-sized actress took to social media with what appears to be a call-out on those advertising weight loss products while using slim girls as models.

According to Eniola Badmus, if those behind such products really believe that their products are effective as they advertise them, then they should use her as an experiment to prove their claim.

Eniola Badmus recently opened up on the struggle she faced being a plus-sized lady.

“When I started, I was rejected a lot and people attributed it to my body size; they were wondering what I had to offer. But I was focused and steadfast with what I was doing because I have a very high spirit. I was focused and that’s why I am excelling. No matter what comes my way, I don’t even think about it. I only think about fresh ideas because when you begin to take things personally, you get distracted. I was trained to be a hero with a lion heart; I am brave at heart. A good man will not want to let me go because I am a very hard working woman and I believe in making money,” she said.
