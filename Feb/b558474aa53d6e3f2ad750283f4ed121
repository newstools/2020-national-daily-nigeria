A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday struck out suit of non-declaration of assets against former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, by the defunct Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property.
Report indicated that Justice Binta Nyako struck out the suit against Ekweremadu after the prosecuting counsel, Pius Akutah, told the court that the former lawyer handling the case for the panel had disappeared with the case file.
The disbanded panel led by Okoi Obono-Obla had in 2018 instituted the suit against Ekweremadu, alleging that, “without reasonable excuse”, the serving senator refused and neglected to declare his assets upon being served the panel’s “notice to declare”.
The office of the AGF had taken over the case and other suits being handled by the SPIP upon a presidential directive dissolving the panel in 2019.
