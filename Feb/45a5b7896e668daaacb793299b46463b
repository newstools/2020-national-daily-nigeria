A Lagos based human rights lawyer, Femi Falana SAN, on Monday renewed his fireworks on President Muhammadu Buhari who he said is breaking the law in his decision not to sack the Service Chiefs of the Nigerian military. He revealed his intention to sue the president if he maintains this position.
Falana, speaking on Sunrise Daily on Channels TV, monitored from Lagos, emphasized that the laws regulating military officers require the retirement of military officers who have served for 35 years or have reached the age of 60.
He declared that a lawsuit would be filed this week in respect of the matter.
Falana advocated that President Buhari “must be prevailed upon” to acknowledge the possibility of “internal sabotage” within the military in the war against insurgency.

The human rights lawyer also said that that statements from the Presidency cautioning against public protests of the failures of government should be “embarrassing” to the President who, before he took the country’s reins, had led public demonstrations.
Falana declared: “Under the public service rule, under the harmonised rules for military officers in Nigeria and under Section 6 of the armed forces act, which empowers the President to make rules and regulations for the military, there is no provision for extension of tenure (for Service Chiefs) beyond the period stipulated by law.
“It has been done in the past, but that does not make it right. There is equality before the law, so, you can’t extend the service of certain officers while you ask others to go after 35 years of service or the attainment of 60 years of age.
“To the best of my knowledge, a suit will be filed during the week, in respect of this matter.”
