The Kano/Jigawa Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has threatened to shutdown supermarkets and shops found patronising foreign rice and other prohibited items.

The agency, in a letter with reference number NCS/KAN/053/S.28 dated 17th February 2020 sent to all supermarkets and shops in the two states, directed them to stop patronising prohibited items or risk being shut down.

However, in the letter, the agency did not indicate when the operation will take effect.

It said the decision was meant to suppress the smuggling of prohibited items in the interest of the nation’s economy and security.

“We deem it fit to write and seek for your cooperation to stop patronising foreign rice and other prohibited items in your supermarket and shop to avoid being closed by Customs operatives,” the letter read, adding that any supermarket or shop found selling prohibited items will be closed down.
