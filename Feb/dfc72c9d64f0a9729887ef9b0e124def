President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday presided over the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) Meeting as the State House, Abuja. The managers of the president at midday on Wednesday sent out pictures of President Buhari presiding over the Wednesday FEC meeting in Abuja in completing their job of proving to Nigerians and the international community there is no vacation for the president as widely reported at the weekend into Monday.
President Buhari was reported on Monday to be proceeding on 20 days’ vacation to the United Kingdom (UK) from where he would proceed to Saudi Arabia for an official function, and thereafter, to Austria for a World Summit.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had debunked the report. The Presidency quickly distributed the president’s participation at the Wednesday FEC meeting to substantive the refutation.
