The Ekiti chapter of the APC has rejected an alleged move by the state’s former Gov. Ayodele Fayose to defect to the ruling party.
The State Publicity Secretary of the party, Ade Ajayi, said on Thursday the party is not a dumping ground “for failed politicians”.
In a statement he signed and released on Thursday, Ajayi described the APC as “a disciplined, refined and integrity-inclined type which would not tolerate people like Fayose,” and that “Fayose is not qualified to be a member of the APC in the state.”
The party was reacting to a statement credited to Fayose that he would defect to the APC if his candidate for the state PDP state chairmanship aspirant failed.
“It is better he stays back in his PDP to get it more destroyed instead of coming to a principled, disciplined, transparent, law-abiding and organised party like the APC,’ said Ajayi.
“The Ekiti APC members know the people behind the masquerade and thereby warn people like Fayose not to turn the APC to a dumping ground where they can defect to.”
Fayose is currently on trial for his complicity in the 2014 multi-billion dollar arms votes candidate his party spent on its presidential candidate Goodluck Jonathan in 2015.
