The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives, at the weekend declared that the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and the APC are complicit in sponsoring candidates with forged certificates for elections in Nigeria. The PDP lawmakers in the Lower Chamber of the National Assembly, therefore, demanded immediate arrest and prosecution of the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and APC as a corporate entity.
The group maintained that Oshiomhole and APC were complicit in presenting a candidate with questionable credentials for the 2019 Bayelsa governorship election.
Leader of the PDP House caucus, Kingsley Chinda, in a statement indicated that both Oshiomhole and the ruling APC are guilty of flouting the Electoral Act which prohibits the fielding of unqualified candidates in an election.

The PDP lawmakers also demanded the prosecution of the Deputy Governorship Candidate of APC in the November 2019 Governorship Election in Bayelsa State, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, under the Criminal Code.
The group remarked: “While we urge  Gov Diri to fully concentrate on the task of ensuring good governance and delivering the dividends of democracy to the people of Bayelsa State and Nigerians, in general, we continue to call for and work towards deepening our democratic practices.”
The PDP candidate in the November 16, 2019, election in Bayelsa State, Senator Duoye Diri, was sworn in as Governor on Friday after the Supreme Court on Thursday nullified the victory of governor-elect, David Lyon, and his Deputy Degi-Eremieoyo, for Degi-Eremieoyo invalid certificates.
