Kaduna State Gov. Nasir El-Rufai, Mamman Daura, Lawal Daura, NSA Babagana Monguno, Sultan of Sokoto and the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai  recruited Jubril Al-Sudani who replaced President Muhammadu Buhari.
Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, stated this on Thursday as he insisted Buhari was dead and buried in a “shallow grave in Saudi Arabia”.
According to him, Monguno’s claim that Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari was overriding the president’s decision was a testament to his allegation.
In a statement he personally signed, Kanu insisted that Kyari was controlling Nigeria as the current leader was an impostor.
“Those Nigerians who out of a combination of laziness, ignorance, envy, stupidity, cowardice, timidity and curse, challenged my irrefutable assertion that Abba Kyari and not the late Buhari is the unelected president of Nigeria, can now see and hear their own National Security Adviser (NSA) Babagana Monguno confirm what IPOB and every top level intelligence agency in the world have known for a long time,” he said.
“I know this revelation from Nigeria’s NSA will come as a shock to brainless and roundly hopeless unity begging one Nigerianists but the inescapable truth remains that IPOB is always right.”
He said all those he listed have now fallen out with each other, hence the infighting.”
The IPOB leader also claimed that Fulanis promised Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidency to buy his silence.
“Today every ethnic group in the damnable British colonial experiment called Nigeria is paying a price for it. Ignore IPOB at your peril.
“How can ordinary Chief of Staff override the orders of a living president and an erstwhile ruthless and unconscionable dictator for that matter? Where are the brains of some people?”
Kanu fled the country in 2017, jumping bail as he was being tried for treason after spending about two years in detention.
