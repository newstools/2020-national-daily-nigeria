The US Centre for Disease Control has warned that grooming, especially facial hairstyles, can  get in the way of effort to control the spread of the novel virus with face masks and respirators.
The equipment is being  used around the world in an effort to combat the global spread of Coronavirus.
According to the centre,  some types of facial hair can keep the exhalation valve from working properly.
Styles such as side whiskers, handlebar mustaches, and several others are okay, but styles such as mutton chops and full beards are not recommended.
Things like goatees and villain mustache are okay, with caution.
The main idea is that the hair should not cross the respirator sealing surface.
Other studies have found out that facial hair naturally harbours a lot of germs.
