Enyimba Football Club’s Chairman Anyansi Agwu has said he received three stitches on his head after the head injury he sustained during the spate of violence that led to the match between his team and rival Abia Warriors was called off by officials in the 24th minute as the angry mob refused to leave the pitch,National Daily learnt.
Trouble started when the referee awarded a penalty to Abia Warriors in the 10th minute, after Abiodun Adebayo brought down James Odeh, but Emeka Isaac missed the spot kick, which sent the visiting supporters into wild jubilation.
That infuriated Warriors’ fans, who then engaged Enyimba supporters in free for all fight, thereby resulting in a free-for-all fracas, which continued spreading, despite appeals by the chairmen of both teams for calm yielded no result.
In the resultant chaos, Anyansi-Agwu sustained a head injury after being hit by a stone and he needed three stitches to stop the blood and cover the wound after the attack, which he noted was instigated and worsened by fans of Abia Warrriors.
Anyansi-Agwu said : “From the VIP box where we were, I went down to instruct our supporters to leave their stand completely. While I was pushing them to leave, so that if they leave that stand, they will not see anyone to attack, the Abia Warriors fans started attacking us.
“They started pursuing us with stones, pellets and sticks. One of the stones landed on my head and that was how I was rushed to the hospital. I had about three stitches on my head after I was rushed to the hospital.”
