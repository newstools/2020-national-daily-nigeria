Shehu Sani hits Ganduje on ban of Almajiri street begging in Kano
Senator Shehu Sani on Tuesday fired Governor Umar Abdulahi Ganduje of Kano State over the ban on Almajiri street begging in the state without first addressing the fundamental factors forcing the people to go on street begging. Though, the governor had explained that the ban on street begging is to encourage children to go to school.
There are indications that the senator may have misfired this time in his criticism of the Kano Governor on the policy of replacing street begging with free and compulsory education in primary and secondary schools in the state.
