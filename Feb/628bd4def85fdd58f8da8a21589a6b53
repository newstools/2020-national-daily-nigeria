Peter, Paul and Jude Okoye seem to have made peace.  Some months back, last year, we saw a video where they all battled in words until it was going to be physical.

Since then both twins have gone their separate ways. As they continued their singing career as Mr P and Rude Boy. But if the news making the rounds is anything worthwhile we may be seeing the end of such solo careers. It’s alledged that Peter Okoye made the following speech about their comeback:

“My dear fans, P-Square is back. Ours is a journey started from our mother’s womb. It was a journey that started from Primary School, continued to St. Murumba College, to when we were in University in Abuja. It was a journey in which we shared childhood memories and grown-up dreams. We are back because brothers do not let each other wander in the dark alone. We are back because we have tried the lonely road and it was not the same.

“I want to take responsibility for what has happened and sincerely apologise to you our fans. For supporting us throughout this journey we owed you so much more than what you have had to endure and I apologise for that. We are embarking now on a new journey with exciting new management (Jude Okoye), new music and new ideas.

“We cannot thank you enough for all your prayers and support throughout this difficult period. Maya Angelou once said that brotherhood is a condition that people have to work at. We will continue to work on that and you can be prepared to be blown away by this new phase of P-Square. God bless all and be assured that you haven’t seen anything yet”.

This is still largely an underground news, as we make attempt to verify the story.
