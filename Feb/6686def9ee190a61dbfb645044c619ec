Kano’s Emir Sanusi Lamido has warned northern youth to stop pushing religion and ethnicity to forge ahead in Nigeria, or else they keep destroying their region.
“You don’t need to rise on being from Kaduna State or being from the North or being a Muslim to get a job,” he said while delivering a speech at the birthday ceremony of Kaduna Gov. Nasir El Rufai on Monday.
“You come with your credentials, your competence, and you can compete with any Nigerian from anywhere.”
He added that the northern leaders need to get northern youths to a point where they don’t need to come from a part of the country to get a job.
““We have been saying this for 20 to 30 years. If the North does not change, the North will destroy itself. The country is moving on. The quota system that everybody talks about must have a sunset clause.
“The rest of the country cannot be investing, educating its children, producing graduates and then they watch us, they can’t get jobs because they come from the wrong state, when we have not invested in the future of our own children.”
The former CBN pointed at how the governor has developed himself over the years as a surveyor, a lawyer, boasting over 80 certificates from Harvard.
He noted education makes a man.
According to him, investing in education is the only way the region will save itself from imminent destruction.
Sanusi lamented that 87 percent of the country’s poverty rate is in the north, with nine states in the zone constituting almost 50 percent of the malnutrition burden of Nigeria.
