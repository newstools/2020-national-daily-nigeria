The All Progressives Congress (APC) youth wing in Bayelsa State on Tuesday berated the continued attack on the Justices of the Supreme Court. The group condemned in totality, the actions of the protesters at the residence of Justice Mary Peter-Odili, in Abuja, on Tuesday, who presided over the Supreme Court panel on the Bayelsa governorship pre-election suit.
The Bayelsa APC youths under the aegis of Bayelsa APC Youth Vanguard for Real Change, chided APC leadership, arguing that the party leadership should blame itself for presenting candidates with forged credentials for the governorship election in the state. Moreover, there were aware of the ongoing litigation but insisted on imposing such candidates on the state APC when there were alternative credible persons.
Comrade Johnson Dume, speaking for the group, advocated that the APC leadership under Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, rather than grandstand, should apologise to its teeming supporters for the “monumental embarrassment” that the nomination had caused them.
The protesters displayed placards chastising the judge for the decision on the governorship election in Bayelsa State on February 13, 2020.
A five-man panel of the Supreme Court led by Justice Odili, in the judgement, nullified the victory of the APC governor-elect, David Lyon and his deputy, Senator Biobarakumo Degi. The panel directed the INEC to withdraw the certificate of return from the APC candidates and issue same to candidates of the party with the next highest votes in the election. The PDP became the beneficiary of the judgment.
