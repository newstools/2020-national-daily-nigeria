It’s a tough battle ahead as City takes the game to Madrid in the round of 16 Champion’s League games. With the latest lineup news. It’s shocking that City will start Sterling, Aguero and Fernadinho from the bench.


Real Madrid know what it takes to win this competition having done so 13 times in their history, including most recently in 2017/18. However, they were eliminated at this stage of the tournament last season and will not want a repeat of that in this campaign. As for Manchester City, they have never won the Champions League and Pep Guardiola is aiming to make history as the first manager to lead them to the trophy.


Both teams will be unhappy with this draw and we are set for a fascinating first leg at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Which team will come out on top and possibly take a lead into the second leg of the tie?
