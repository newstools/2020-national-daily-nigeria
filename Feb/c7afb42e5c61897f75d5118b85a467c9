No fewer than 30 people were killed and 18 vehicles destroyed by Boko Haram militants who stormed Auno, along the Maiduguri-Damaturu, at about 9:50 pm on Sunday.
Borno Gov. Babagana Umara Zulum visited the place on Monday.
The military authority and the police haven’t made  any statement to the effect.
Apart from the 30 people killed, some passengers in three buses were also kidnapped, according to those on the governor’s entourage.
Residents of the area narrated how the insurgents stormed the area and started shooting, sending everybody into bushes for safety before the villagers returned Monday morning.
Zulum, worried, however, asked members of the civilian JTF, and hunters to remain vigilant and work with the military and police to ensure that such incident does not occur again.
