The Coronavirus outbreak which has killed about 200 people in China an infected hundreds of people has finally reached Africa, with Botswana announcing its first ever suspected case on Friday.
A statement on the Botswana Government twitter handle and signed by the nation’s Director, Health Services, Malaki Tshipayagae said the suspected case was registered on Thursday.
It said the suspected case was registered at Sir Seretse Khama International Airport upon arrival using Ethiopian Airways from China.
“The suspect case is still under isolation at Block 8. Clinic and investigations are on-going,” it said.
The escalating global health crisis has claimed more than 200 lives — all in China — and infected close to 10,000 people worldwide. As they seek to contain the virus, authorities in multiple countries are balancing the need for warnings against the risk of creating global panic.
However, there are signs that’s already happening, with face masks selling out in stores and people locking themselves at home. Some people in central China — the epicenter of the outbreak — are desperately taking any flight out, regardless of destination, as governments worldwide suspend flights from China and impose restrictions on travelers from the mainland.
