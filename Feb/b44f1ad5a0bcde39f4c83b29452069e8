Leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has listed some reasons why he believed President Muhammadu Buhari is not charged of the present administration running the affairs of the country.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Kanu explained that the face-off between the National Security Adviser, NSA, Maj. Gen Babagana Monguno (rtd) and President Muhammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, is a pointer to the fact the President Buhari is not the one in charge at Aso Rock.
According to him, members of the cabal are the one running the affairs of the country, not President Muhammadu Buhari whom, stressing that the man many believed is President Buhari in Aso Rock, was an impostor from Sudan.

Kanu tweeted: “If certainly, the Buhari that came into power in 2015 is still in charge of the Nigerian government, why are they confused with who the service chiefs should report to? I’ve said many times that a Sudanese impostor is the Buhari in Aso Rock. @StateDept.”
It would be recalled that a circular had few days ago surfaced online where the NSA,  Maj. Gen Babagana Monguno (rtd) was accusing Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, of hijacking the coordination of security leadership across Nigeria.
The NSA had claimed that Kyari had allegedly sidelined him in making strategic decisions in national security operations.
