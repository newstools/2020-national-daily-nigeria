The All Progressives Congress has lost Bayelsa state to the Peoples Democratic Party as the Supreme Court on Thursday nullified the election of Bayelsa State governor-elect, David Lyon and his Deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo.
The apex court led by Justice Mary Peter-Odili directed the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to the All Progressives Congressâ€™ candidates who were earlier declared winners of the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state.
The five-man panel ordered INEC to immediately issue fresh certificates to the candidates of the party with the next highest votes.
Justice Ejembi Ekwo gave the ruling after disqualifying the APC deputy governorship candidate, Degi-Eremienyo, as a candidate in the election.
Going by the new judgement, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP having scored 143,172 votes has, therefore, emerged winner.
