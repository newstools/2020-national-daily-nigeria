President Muhammadu Buhari may have given nod to the commencement of implementation of the visa on arrival policy in Nigeria for foreign nationals. Accordingly, the president on Tuesday officially presented to the public the Nigeria Visa Policy (NVP) for the year 2020. He noted that the document presented at the State House, Abuja, is a revised version of the existing policy.
The President explained that the review of the visa policy is intended to attract innovation, specialised skills and knowledge from other countries to complement local ones.
It was highlighted that the 2020 visa policy will enhance business opportunities and achieve African integration through the visas on arrival for holders of passports of African Union countries. There are 79 visa classifications in the revised policy, one of which is the Visa on arrival.
President Buhari had in November 2019 while in Egypt announced that travelers from African countries will be issued visas on arrival at the entry point into Nigeria commencing from January 2020.
It was highlighted that the new policy guarantees Africans with valid AU passport who wish to come into Nigeria on short visit, business, and tourism; indicating that the visa grants legal stay up to 90 days.
