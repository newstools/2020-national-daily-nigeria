NCDC, Port Health Services and State Epidemiologists were aware of the process for identification and confirmation.
“We‘ll review these criteria as additional information on CoV2019 becomes available,’’ he said.
He said that NCDC has continued to make advisories available to Nigerians on the novel coronavirus and how to protect themselves and had also published Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to keep Nigerians informed
Since the emergence of the coronavirus, we have been working everyday to learn as quickly as possible about this new virus.
“Ongoing research on its transmissibility and virulence will determine our response across Nigeria,” the minister added.
Ehanire appealed to Nigerians that if they experience symptoms of coronavirus like respiratory illness, restlessness or cough within 14 days of travel to China they should contact NCDC immediately on its toll-free number on – 0800-970000-10.
