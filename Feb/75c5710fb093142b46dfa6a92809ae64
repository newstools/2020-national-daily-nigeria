In the most recent involvement of the Nigeria police I counterterrorism operation, no fewer than 250 Ansaru terrorists lost their lives in an offensive by the Special Operatives of Operation Puff Adder backed by the Special Forces of the Police Airwing.
According to police authorities, the special units stormed one of the largest operational camps of the Ansaru Terror Group (also housing other bandits and kidnappers) located in Kuduru Forest, Birnin Gwari, Kaduna early Wednesday.
The operation was carried out by a combined team of operatives of Operation Puff Adder made up of the Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), Special Forces, Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Special Tactical Squad (STS) and Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).
“The operation was necessitated by actionable intelligence linking terror and criminal elements in the super camp to series of terror-related violence, kidnappings, gun-running, cattle rustling and other heinous crimes across the country,” said Force PRO Frank Mba.
During the operation, a Police Bell helicopter, which provided aerial and intelligence cover for the ground troops came under attack from the bandits using sophisticated anti-aircraft rifles and GPMG.
Mba said the pilot and the co-pilot, however, demonstrated uncommon courage and expertise as they safely landed the aircraft at the Air Force Base, Kaduna.
“They were thereafter evacuated for medical treatment. Both officers who sustained non-life threatening injuries are currently receiving treatment and are in stable condition,” he said.
Inspector General of Police Muhammad Adamu has since assured citizens  of safety and sustained intelligence-led operations against bandits across the nation.
