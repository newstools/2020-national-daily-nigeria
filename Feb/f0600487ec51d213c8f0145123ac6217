The youth wing of the apex socio-cultural Igbo group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, says it has uncovered plans by some Igbo leaders to instigate the Southeast against President Muhammadu Buhari and the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu.
OYC in a statement signed by President-General, Mazi okechukwu isiguzoro and Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, the Secretary-General, said the Igbo leaders were working with some international agencies and embassies in Nigeria to discredit the anti-corruption stance of President Buhari-led Federal Government.

The statement added, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has uncovered plot by some few Igbo leaders and cabal to instigate Igbos and Nigerians against President Muhammadu Buhari as its confirmed they are working with some international agencies and embassies in Nigeria to discredit the anti-corruption stance of Federal Government.
“We therefore warn fifth columnists from using Igbo platform Ohanaeze Ndigbo as a weapon of vendetta against President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.
“OYC pleads with those elders not to destroy pan Igbo organization for percunairy gains, as President Buhari means well for the country.
