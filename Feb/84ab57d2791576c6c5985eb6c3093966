The management of Rangers International F.C, have made an official appeal to the Nigerian football league organizers, LMC, against the decisions of F.C.T based referee, Jacob Gwatsa, over his controversial handling of match day 20, NPFL fixture with Akwa United in Enugu where the referee ignored two clear penalty calls against the visiting side that ran away with a 1-2 win,National Daily learnt.
Rangers management wondered why the same referee that had his red card decision against its player, Pascal Seka in a rescheduled match day 8 fixture against host, Bendel Insurance in Benin last season, rescinded by the league organizers would be at the center of controversial calls barely a year after.
The letter which was signed by team manager of the Enugu side, Barrister Amobi Ezeaku for the G.M, read in part, “… Let it be stated that this same Jacob Gwatsa issued a red card in the match day 8, match number 045A Rescheduled between Bendel Insurance F.C vs. Rangers International F.C, Enugu. The LMC reversed the red card decision.”
The appeal reads further, “Asides the numerous questionable calls made by Referee Jacob Gwatsa, in the match day 20 fixture, the height of it was the penalty appeals which the said referee waved off to the chagrin of even his co-officials in the game. On two occasions, the opposing defenders handled the ball in the penalty box and a striker (Seka Pascal) was hacked down inside the box and the referee waved play on”.
Rangers wondered if it was a coincidence that the same referee whose decision was reversed by the LMC barely a year ago could be found culpable again or was it just human error or a clear case of targeted aggression to the club due to past meetings?
The ‘Flying Antelopes’, Rangers International F.C is appealing to LMC for justice not only to be done but must be seen to have been done by the league organizing body so as to maintain the high standard already attained.
