Minister of State for Labour and Productivity Festus Keyamo has blamed his party for throwing its victories away needlessly, and the senior lawyer equally praised the Supreme Court for all is judgements so far.
His party APC however said the apex court judgement is dangerous to Nigeria’s democracy.
The apex court on Thursday in a unanimous judgement led by Justice Mary Odili sacked David Lyon as governor elect of Bayelsa state because his running mate Degi-Eremieoyo forged certificate presented to INEC.
Thereafter, INEC Chairman, Yakubu Mahmoud on Friday then declared PDP candidate, Douye Diri winner and issued him certificate of return.
According to Keyamo on his Twitter page,  the Supreme Court has been firm and resolute so far regarding pre-election cases and Election Petitions. I commend their lordships.
“As a party, we have to look at our own internal party mechanisms that make us give our victories needlessly away to the opposition and take appropriate actions.”
