Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has said he will no longer tolerate and accept the cliché “unknown gunmen”, used to describe killers after they have perpetrated heinous crimes.

“I have told security agencies that the killers must be fished out at all costs because Government will no longer take excuses of “unknown gunmen” who kill and maim at will”.

Speaking at a one day Stakeholders Peace and Security Community Dialogue, held at the Jos Government House on Tuesday, Lalong said he has directed that the community leaders and Ardos be invited and questioned with a view to assisting the security agencies with information that will lead to the arrest of the killers who has killed over 30 persons during a renewed attack in Plateau Local Government Areas of Mangu and Bokkos.

Insisting that the killers are not ghosts, the Governor said he is happy that his directive has been acted upon, and sooner than later, the killers will be unmasked and brought before the law to answer for their crimes.

However, speaking on the topic “Domestication of Community Policing and Exploring Indeginous Options in Plateau State”, Lalong assured his listeners that he will strengthen the existing community policing mechanism that are already on ground in the State.
 
“This dialogue seeks to explore ways towards undertaking a wholistic overview of the prevailing security challenges in the State, with specific reference to a community policing model that can better respond to public safety and security.



“The Inspector General of Police last month met with Governors of the North Central States in Lafia – Nasarawa State, for a Security Summit where we adopted Community Policing as a better tool to dealing with the security situation in our geo-political zone.


“Happily, we already have structures on ground which are in tandem with the Community Policing model, such as the Operation Rainbow, Early warning System, Vigilante Volunteers and Community based Intelligence Volunteers”, Lalong said.



Speaking to a cheering audience who were delighted with the governor on his new resolve to deal with bandits that have been terrorising the State, Governor Lalong expressed commitment to reach out and seek ways to forestall reoccurrence of insecurity in the State.
