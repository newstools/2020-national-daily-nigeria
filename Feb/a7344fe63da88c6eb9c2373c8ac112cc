The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday may have indicated readiness to ‘grind’ the factional National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, at the inauguration of the new Governor of Bayelsa State on Friday if he goes ahead with his threat the no one will be sworn in as Bayelsa governor following the Supreme Court judgment which annulled the victory of the APC in the election. The party declared that Oshiomhole’s comment on the Supreme Court judgement on the Bayelsa State Governorship election was an empty and inconsequential ranting.
PDP, therefore, warned Oshiomhole, to steer clear of Bayelsa State as his apparent plots to trigger violence in the state has failed.
The PDP further counseled Oshiomhole to be careful with his utterances and not use any forms of venomous garrulity and clear misuse of language to destabilize Nigeria and truncate the hard-earned democracy.
“The people of Bayelsa State knows as a fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) under our laws, cannot take instructions from any individual, let alone a factional national chairman of a dysfunctional political party like the APC.
“The PDP, as a law-abiding party, counsels Oshiomhole to rein in himself and desist from all odious designs against Bayelsa State, her people and government.
“The PDP also calls on the people of Bayelsa State to remain calm as their mandate has been restored and cannot be taken away by the ranting of any individual who has no stake whatsoever in the wellbeing of his own home state,” the party declared in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary.
