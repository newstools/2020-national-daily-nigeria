Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, says he remains the Oluwo of Iwoland despite his suspension by the Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers.
Oluwo Akanbi was on Friday suspended for six months by the Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers.
The royal fathers arrived at the decision to suspend Oba Akanbi at their emergency meeting held at Osun State Government Secretariat, Abere, presided over by Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi.
A committee headed by Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Adedotun, was also constituted by the council to further investigate the matter involving Oluwo and Obas in Iwo land.
But in a post on Friday, the embattled monarch said he remained the Oluwo of Iwoland until Governor Adegboyega Oyetola ratify the decision by the Osun state traditional council.
He also stated that the suspension was recommended because of his ‘swagger’

This was revealed in a post on his Instagram page on Friday.
In the post, Oluwo attached a video, showing him partying and dancing to a song that states that he was not pained by “abuses”.
The statement reads: “Oba (Dr) Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi Telu is the one and only Oluwo of Iwoland.
“He was never suspended as Oluwo of Iwoland.
“Osun State Traditional Council has only recommended his suspension from the council meetings and activities for six months on the guise that his conduct (been too flashy, stylish, human rights defender and swagging) and that is even subject to Governor’s approval. This clarification is important for the public notice!”
