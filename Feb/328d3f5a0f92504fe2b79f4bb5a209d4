Wenger remains Arsenal most successful manager in history
National Daily gathered that Arsene Wenger has been conspicuous by his absence since leaving Arsenal in about two years ago.
There is no doubt that Wenger is the greatest manager in the history of Arsenal as a football club but was still scarred by his departure and also the fans who were divided in the latter part of his 22-year reign.
However, the Arsenal hierarchyare keen to welcome Wenger back to the Emirates and it is understood senior figures at the club have been making inroads to talk him into it National Daily learnt.
It left an emotional reaction when Wenger, 70, insisted that he will forever be an Arsenal fan but admitted publicly that he has been reluctant to go back.
Wenger has since taken up a role with FIFA
But the hierarchy would love to welcome him back to help garner support among the fans.
The Frenchman, who has since taken up a role with FIFA, would surely get a heroic homecoming and it would help unify the supporter base as new manager Mikel Arteta tries to get the club back on track.
