Ondo Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu will have a lot to contend with in the coming guber election as opposition mounts right within his ruling APC.
Some chieftains of the party, under the aegis of the APC Unity Forum, are not in favour of Akeredolu’s re-election.
The group said it would present a strong and credible candidate for the party’s primary election scheduled to hold in July.
Senator representing the Ondo North Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Ajayi Boroffice, said the APC Unity Forum, would present an alternative in the forthcoming governorship election.
According the deputy majority leader of the Senate, members of the Unity Forum are currently working together to present a consensus aspirant to fight it out with Akeredolu at the party’s primary.
Boroffice stated this in Akure, the state capital, on Saturday during his empowerment programme for women in the Ondo Central and Ondo South senatorial districts.
“We in Unity Group of APC in Ondo State will have one person to vie for the primary of the party.
“It may be Chief Olusola Oke, Jimi Odimayo, Ife Oyedele, Olusegun Abraham or Bukola Adetula. It can even be me or anybody in the group since we have a common goal of presenting a credible candidate for the party in the coming election.”
Akeredolu rode on the back of the APC ex-national chairman John Odigie-Oyegun to win the party primary, a victory that nearly split the part at the national level,, which eventually saw Oyegun out of office–against his wish for a second term.
Among those uniting against the governor now is the first runner in the primary and candidate of APC’s national leader Bola Tinubu.
Olusegun Abraham has been a perennial contestant in the state.
