A new camp where kidnapped children are being kept has been uncovered by residents of Okoerin community in Ilorin West Local Government area of Kara State.

The den, a storey building, was uncovered by some residents of the community when a woman raised an alarm over the whereabout of her daughter.

It was during the search for the missing child, whom is said to have gone to dispose refuse under a bridge along Ibrahim Taiwo road, that the house was discovered.

When the place was uncovered, the residents immediately alerted the Police who came and arrested the two suspected kidnappers and recovered the 13 children in their captivity.



Mr Yomi Adebayo, who resides in the area, said the building had been in existence for a long time without any knowledge of the kind of business being conducted there.
Adebayo said four of the 13 children kept in the camp by the kidnappers are female.
Confirming the development, Public Relations Officer of the State Police, Mr Samuel Ajayi-Okasanmi, said the command would commence an investigation into the matter.
Ajayi-Okasanmi advised the residents of Okoerin to continue to be law-abiding and assist the command to get to the root of the matter.
