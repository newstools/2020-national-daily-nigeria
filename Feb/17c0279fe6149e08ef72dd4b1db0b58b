Lagos, Osun lead

Lagos with a net revenue of N119. 02bn and a total debt burden of N968. 16bn led other states as they contravened the guidelines of the Debt Management Office (DMO) by contracting debts exceeding their 12-month revenues.

In the latest statistics released by Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC), the DMO
guidelines on borrowing provide that no state should have outstanding loans that are more than 50% of their total revenues in the previous 12 months.

In the report, all the states had debts more than 50% of their 12-month revenues.


The report showed that a state had debt to revenue ratios as high as 781% while some had lower debt to revenue ratios. However, the FRC argued that none of the states could be said to have overborrowed.

It hinged its argument on the fact that the President of the country that was supposed to set the borrowing limit for the states, according to the FRC Act, had not set any limit.



With Lagos State debt ratio standing at 814.41%, meaning it has gone beyond the DMO limit by 763.41%.

Lagos was followed by Osun State with a debt to revenue ratio of 781.71%. While it had net revenue of N22.84 billion, its total public debt stood at N178.52 billion. This means that the state had a debt to revenue ratio of 781.71% and had gone beyond the limit set by the DMO by 731.71%.

Other top states in terms of high debt to revenue ratios include Cross River, Ekiti, Ogun, Plateau, Edo, Bauchi, Adamawa, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Imo and Oyo States. The Federal Capital Territory Administration also made the list of top subnational governments with high debt to revenue ratio.

Cross River State had net revenue of N36.95 billion, a debt of N225.91 billion, debt to revenue ratio of 611.31%. It, therefore, had gone beyond the limit by 561.31%.
