The bereaved mother of the late Remo Stars football club player, Tiamiyu Kazeem, who was killed in a faceoff with some SARS officers, during a condolence visit to the family on Tuesday Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, revealed that operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) attempted to arrest her son two weeks before his death.
“Two weeks before his death, my son complained that operatives of SARS usually surround his car. In fact, he called his father on many of these occasions.
“There was a certain day that his elder brother’s wife put to bed and he was at the hospital. Just as he went in, I was called that SARS operatives had surrounded his car. I rose and went there and on getting there, I met them.
“I called one of their bosses immediately because, during Gbenga Daniel’s tenure, I served all policemen in the state souvenirs whenever they had meetings. So, he told them to leave my son alone and they did. “They told me they were sorry, and I told them they should be sorry for themselves,” she narrated.

Recounting how her son died, the anguish mother narrated: “He woke up on that Saturday morning and said he wanted to get to his manager’s place. After he left, I called him a few minutes past 11.00 am to tell that him his food was ready. The person with him said he stepped down from his vehicle to buy something and before he came back, there were SARS operatives seated in his car.
“They took his phone and interrogated him. He told them he was a footballer. And he was whisked to Abeokuta in their vehicle during which the incident happened.”
