Apostle Suleiman at a Church Service reiterated the prophesy of Rev. Father Mbaka of the Divine Adoration Ministry, Enugu, making a prophesy that the controversial Governor of Bayelsa State will be sent packing from office in less than 70 days. He had acknowledged the stoppage of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governor-elect by the Supreme Court and declaration and inauguration of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate who lost the governorship election at the polls, thereafter, declared that it cannot stand, saying that both the governor and the PDP will be removed. However, Apostle Suleiman gave a caveat, counseling the governor and his party to pray. This indicates that the political tragedy can be averted and the situation redeemed.
The Apostle had said: “the news I am hearing in Bayelsa now is that governor-elect was removed a day to his swearing in, and a new one was sworn in; it won’t last; he will be removed within 70 days. His party will be removed from office. He should pray.”
Reverend Father Mbaka had at an event in Delta State prophesied that the Bayelsa Governor will be removed in 60 days. Mbaka gave no condition of remedy like Suleiman. All the prophesies are expected to be fulfilled in April.
