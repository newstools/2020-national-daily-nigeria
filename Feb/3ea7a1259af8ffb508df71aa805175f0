Nigerian music sensation Zlatan Ibile has in a recent hilarious video threatened to flush veteran Nollywood actor Chinedu Ikedieze in the Water Closet.

In what appears to be a skit, Chinedu Ikedieze and the musician, Zlatan where spotted in a popular hotel in Lagos where the former was captured devouring the food of the later who warned and threatened to flush him away if he fails to give him back his food.

It can be recalled that Zlatan dropped a new song which he named after one of the comic Nollywood duo, ‘Unripe PawPaw.’ The singer used the picture of the duo Aki and Paw Paw (Chinedu Ikedieze and Osita Iheme) for the song cover which we believe is part of the reason for their meet up at the hotel where the skit was created.
