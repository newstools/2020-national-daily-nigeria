No fewer than twenty thousand
Zamfara’s APConce again got depleted as no fewer than 20,000 of its members defected to the ruling PDP in the state on Wednesday.
The defectors were from Bakura and Gumi Local Government areas of the state.
Gov. Bello Mohammed Matawalle described the defection as a big loss to the APC.
” Their decamping may be connected to what has been put on ground by this administration led by me,” he said while receiving the defectors..
According to Matawalle, terror attacks and kidnappings have been brought to an end as commercial activities have fully returned to every part of Zamfara state.
Matawalle urged Zamfara people irrespective of political affiliation to contribute towards the development of the state.
Party chairman Alhaji Ibrahim Malaha described the movement as well development.
He assured the new members of equal treatment, saying that they should consider themselves as card-carrying members of the party.
” We are ready to welcome everybody into PDP fold because we are practising all-inclusive government, ” he said.
It could be recalled that early this week, eight council chairmen defected to PDP.
