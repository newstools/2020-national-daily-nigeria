Former Kaduna Sen Shehu Sani described the RCCG Pastor Enoch Adeboye’s protest march as throwing caution to the wind after a long while of dilly-dallying and sitting on the fence.
“Pastor Adeboye finally disembarking from the fence of caution, moderation, and neutrality and leading a match against insecurity is commendable. Protest gives wings and wheels to prayers,” Sani tweeted on Sunday.
According to him, Adeboye’s protest march will give ”wings and wheels” to prayers in the country.
The march had commenced from the church’s National Headquarters in Ebute Metta, Lagos State—in finalizing a three-day fasting and praying programme that CAN organized for the government and the military.
Adeboye and his members were protesting against the constant killing of Christians in the North and other parts of the country.
