Paul Okoye A.k.a Rudeboy, one half of famous music duo, Psquare, has hinted on a possible return of Psquare.

The “Reason with me” singer during an interview with Ugandan media outfit NSB Uncut was asked about the possible return of Psquare and he didn’t decline a possible return of the duo.

He said; even though its going to happen its gonna be later later, I’ve made mistakes in my life that I don’t want to regret again. So when I say later later it maybe 5 or 10years but not anytime soon”, said Rudeboy.

“Well, its not for me to say, the difference between what was happening before and what it happening now is what people see and what they expect to see, musically it is the same thing. I don’t think it will happen”.

When asked if he talks to his twin brother Peter (Mr P) he said; “whatever I say here is gonna be turned around in any media. It is a family issue and I don’t talk about it if it was music that was the issue I will talk about it”.

Also speaking about international record deals Rudeboy noted that most Nigerian musicians does not need those foreign distribution companies because they are doing well here which is what matters most.

‘I don’t even think any African artiste deserve all those record labels. Most top artistes in Nigeria were into those labels but they left because until you get in there then you will understand what it is all about. You will find out that I was even better the way I was. We and Universal didn’t use up to 5months before we left because the way we were thinking is different”, he said.
