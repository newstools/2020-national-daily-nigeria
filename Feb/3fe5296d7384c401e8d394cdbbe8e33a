THE Tin Can Island Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has set a target of N540 billion for itself in year 2020 expecting to collect not less than N47.4billion on monthly basis as revenue.
Although the customs headquarter in Abuja is yet to give targets to all its Command across the country.
The Public Relations Officer of the Command Mr. Uche Ejesieme disclosed this while describing the Customs Area Controller of the Command, Comptroller Musa Baba Abdullahi as a proactive officer who has envisaged the expectations and started sensitizing the stakeholders on how to realise the target.
According to him, Comptroller Musa in the last couple of weeks had held meetings with different groups and stakeholders in the port and sought their corporation for the year 2020, while appreciating their supports to the command in 2019.
Uche said through support of stakeholders the Command was able to surpass its 2019 revenue target by N4billion.
“We had a target of N342 billion in 2019 and we were able to make N346billion with an excess of N4billion.
Using the same projection, we are envisaging that the command out of the N2trillion target government has given us, Tin Can Command is envisaging to et N540bilion for the year 2020. This translates to N47.4 billion every month.”
“It is actually not going to be easy, but the Controller has put some strategies in place,” Mr Ejesieme said.
