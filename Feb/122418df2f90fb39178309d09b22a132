Adesua Etomi-Wellington a Nigerian actress and wife to music mogul, Banky W has recently come under attack days after celebrating her birthday.

It all started when controversial OAP, Toke Makinwa wished Susu a happy birthday and added that Adesua was not actually cool behind camera but ‘crazy’.

Xoxomysterypage also responded to Toke’s observation by saying Adesua is not a saint, that she knew when Adesua was dating Banky W and Remi, but when Remi dumped her, she switched to Banky w.

This statement has however stirred up comments from different people that claimed they know her hidden stories.

Below are the screenshots of the comments:
 




What is your opinion on this? Is Toke Makinwa wrong for saying Adesua is not cool or is xoxomysterypage at fault here?
