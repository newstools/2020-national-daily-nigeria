The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs has described as unfortunate and misleading the statement by Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Matthew Kukah, that the country was heading towards a precipice as a result of insecurity.
Bishop Kukah had on Tuesday during the funeral mass of Seminarian Michael Nnadi at Good Shepherd Seminary, Kaduna, who was abducted and later killed by the Boko Haram insurgent, hit President Muhammadu Buhari over the rising level of insecurity in the country.
He said neither Islam nor the north could identify any real benefits from last five years that have been consumed by the locusts that the administration of President Buhari has unleashed on the country.
Bishop Kukah had concluded that after five years in office, President Buhari brought about nepotism and clannishness into the military and the ancillary security agencies.

However, the NSCIA, in a statement late Tuesday night by its Head, Media and Communications, Ibrahim Aselemi, said the comments by the respected cleric were misleading.
The group said utterances of religious leaders should be guided by cohesion.
The statement reads in part: “The comments by Rev Fr. Mathew Hassan Kukah, a leader we admire so much is very unfortunate. As religious leaders, our utterances should be guided by trio of national cohesion, security and love for our fatherland.
“The comments are misleading and carefully crafted to weaken the confidence of Nigerians on Buhari’s government. Are the duo of Emefiele and Obiora Muslims from the North? Yet, Buhari appointed them Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Rev Fr Kukah is being economical with the truth.”
