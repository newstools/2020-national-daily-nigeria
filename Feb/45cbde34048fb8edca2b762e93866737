While his colleagues at the Lagos Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, were allegedly looking for a way to save his scalp, a policeman taken in Tuesday for shooting a citizen dead has taken his own life too.
The killer cop identified as Eze, according to the Punch, hanged himself with his own trousers.
“He was brought to the state CID for investigation and prosecution.
“But he hanged himself in the cell around 2 am today. He was attached to the Dangote factory and shot a man dead,” a source told the newspaper.
“I am shocked he could do that. We were even still trying to look for a way to help him. This is just too sad,” another source was quoted as saying.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, has equally confirmed the incident.
He promised to issue a statement on the suicide later in the day.
