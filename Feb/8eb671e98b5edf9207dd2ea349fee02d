Kwara United FC Head Coach, Coach Abdullahi Biffo has called for patience, as the team prepares to engage Dakkaka FC in the Week 22 NPFL encounter on Sunday.
The team lost 2-0 to Enyimba on Wednesday in the Week 13 NPFL outstanding match at the Enyimba Stadium in Aba, and the coach concluded that patience has to be applied in the remaining fixtures, as the lost to Enyimba does not reflect the team’s display.
A goal each at the start and end of the game handed Enyimba a hard earned 2-0 win, with Stanley Dimgba and Victor Mbaoma scoring in the 5th and 85th minute respectively.
Coach Biffo told National Daily that losing to Enyimba is not a setback, considering their status, and been a continental team, but we don’t deserve to lose the encounter on Wednesday, going by the way we played’, he had said.
‘The game is about goals, and we indeed created the chances, as we do in our previous matches, but couldn’t score, maybe owing to anxiety, which  I think, only patience can cure.
He averred that the team has so far played 11 matches after the taking over of Delta Force, winning five, losing four and playing two draws, adding that the position from take over period and now has changed.
He said that the ultimate target this season was to sustain the NPFL status, even as he called on the stakeholders to continue to pray and support the team to achieve the set goals.
Coach of Enyimba FC, Fatai Osho, while analysing the game, said that his team was lucky, adding that the Ilorin based Kwara United FC showed class and commitment, but could not convert most of the chances created.
He expressed worries ahead of future NPFL and continental hostilities, following injuries, which he says, has knocked off about 14 of his regular players.
The team’s injury profile continued to rise with defenders Ampiah and Timothy Danladi succumbing to injuries during the course of the Kwara United FC encounter.
