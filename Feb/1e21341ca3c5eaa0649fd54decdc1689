Junaid Mohammed, one of thought leaders from the north, has once again revealed the south-south should forget the thought of getting back to power by way of zoning come 2023.
The elders fro the region began their agitation lately, saying they need four years to completethe eight-year term of former President Goodluck Jonathan, an ijaw man.
“What makes anybody think that those who are now holding power are going to voluntarily surrender power in 2023?,” he said in an interview by the Sun.
“So, zoning and rotation afford us the worst.”
According to him,  no one would have given the South South a two term, adding that the region wouldn’t have produced a president at all if not for the death of Umaru Yar’Adua.
“Some corrupt northern politicians in the PDP cut a deal with Jonathan, but the deal backfired; it didn’t work,” he said.
“Now they want to go the way the other two regions in the South, that is, by blackmail and agitation, let them go and join them.
“There is nothing wrong with it; after all the other people have been doing it, why should they be left behind.
“If Umaru Yar’Adua didn’t die and he did his eight years, it was absolutely certain that Goodluck Jonathan wouldn’t have been the president.
