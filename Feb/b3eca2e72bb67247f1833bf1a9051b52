The World Heavy Weight Champion, Anthony Joshua, was in Abuja to obtain Nigerian National Identification card in demonstration of his Nigerian citizenship.
He was at the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Abuja, for registration for the NID card.
The NIMC shared pictures of Anthony Joshua during the registration process on its official Twitter handle with the caption, “Anthony Joshua enrolls for the National Identification Number and issued his NIN slip.”
The tweet precipitated sharp responses from Nigerians who complained of their experiences in the delay to get PIN number years after registration. They protested the preference being given to the World Boxing Heavy Weight Champion by the commission.
