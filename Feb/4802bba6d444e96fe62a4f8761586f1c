Jimi Agbaje, who was the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections in Lagos State, has denied that the National leader of the All Progressives (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, sponsored his campaign.
Speaking on Wednesday, Agbaje described those allegations as political gimmicks to ridicule him.

He said: “There were many things said. I was accused of being the opposition’s mole in the party, saying that it was Bola Tinubu that was sponsoring me.
“All those allegations were their own figment of imaginations because Tinubu that they are talking about, I had yet to meet him in the past six years, so where is that coming from?”
Agbaje eventually lost to Babajide Sanwo-olu at the polls.
