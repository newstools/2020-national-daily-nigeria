Rt. Hon. ( Dr ) Mudashiru Ajayi Obasa, Speaker, Lagos House of Assembly and Chairman of State Legislatures in Nigeria has advised traders in the state to come together and have a central power supply system for their market, rather than having individual generating sets which had been the root cause of recurrent fire outbreaks recorded in the market place.

The speaker suggested this as a way to avert the unexpected fire incidents in his response to request of members of  Market Leaders And Traders Association of Nigeria Lagos Chapter led by their president, Comrade Christopher Okpala, who paid him a courtesy visit  on Tuesday, February 11, 2020.

Obasa said,”having a common source of power supply  to serve the whole market will go a long way to curb incessant fire outbreak in our  markets,which has been of a huge loss to you traders.

“I urge you to constantly liaise with the Local Government Councils and Neighborhood Safety Corps in your areas of operation to deal with the problem of blocked drainage and insecurity particularly those caused by hoodlums.

“I also implore you to also help the government by paying your taxes as at when due.” Obasa said.

The President of Market Leaders And Traders Association of Nigeria Lagos Chapter, Comrade Christopher Okpala in his opening address said they have come to pay  the speaker a courtesy visit and present to him an award of Extra-Ordinary Ambassador of Commerce.

The traders also said they have named their 2020 edition of their football competition Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa Traders Cup. Part of those who received the visiting traders are; Hon. Olawale S. Olayiwola (Mushin 2), Hon. Sanni Okanlawon (Kosofe 1), Chief of Staff to the Speaker, Hon. Saka Fafunmi and others.
