President Donald Trump on Monday approved the transition schedule of Joe Biden, candidate of the Democratic Party, projected winner of the November US presidential election.  The US president withdrew his initial obstruction of the agency of government responsible for Joe Biden’s transition to the White House for the January 2021 inauguration of the new US president. However, Trump still declined to concede defeat in the election.
Trump in a tweet on Monday declared that it is time for the General Services Administration to “do what needs to be done.”  He, however, maintained he was not conceding, with the assurance that he would prevail in his case before the inauguration date. According to Trump, “Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail!”
While the claims of stolen vot4s prevail, there has not been clear evidence of electoral fraud since the November 3 election.
The approval for the transition office implies that Biden and his team will now have access to funds, office space, as well as interacting with federal government officials.
Biden’s office had some hours earlier announced the nomination of a highly experienced group for top US foreign policy and security posts.  They expect henceforth that the GSA would now allow “support necessary to carry out a smooth and peaceful transfer of power.”
Biden’s transition Director, Yohannes Abraham, in a statement, declared: “In the days ahead, transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests, and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies.”
Trump had submitted to the transition after Michigan certified its results declaring Biden the winner. This was followed by a rally of strong supporters  of Trump demanding that the electoral conflict must stop.
