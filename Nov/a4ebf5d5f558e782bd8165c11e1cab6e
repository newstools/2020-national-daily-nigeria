The lawmaker representing Esan North-East/Esan South-East Federal Constituency, Edo State, in the House of Representatives of the Nigerian National Assembly, Rt. Hon. Sergius Oseasochie Ogun, has congratulated the Governor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki of Edo State, and the dependable Deputy Governor Phillip Shaibu as they take the oath of office on Thursday for a second tenure of another four years.

 


“As you begin your second term today , I have no doubt in my mind that you are irrevocably committed to Making Edo Great Again. Your laudable achievements in the first four years is clearly a pointer to the loads of goodies and dividends of democracy Edolites should expect in your second coming.
“Coming on the heels of a hard-fought electoral battle against a gang of implacable political Goliaths who were bent on holding the state to a criminal ransom, today’s inauguration ceremony is surely something to sing and dance about. It is indisputably one of the beautiful things  happening in Edo State this year; a year that has been irreducibly distorted by prolonged periods of lockdown occasioned by the pandemic and civil unrest which emanated from the  recent END SARS protests, Ogun declared.
the lawmaker added: “With your historic second term inauguration today, Edo is surely moving forward to higher heights of development and greatness. Congratulations once again your excellencies!”
