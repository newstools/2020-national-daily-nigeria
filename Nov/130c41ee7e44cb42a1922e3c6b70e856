The Rivers State Waste Management Agency (RIWAMA) has enjoined all residents in the state to come out and clean their environment during Saturday’s monthly environmental sanitation exercise scheduled for Saturday, October 30, 2020.
In a statement signed by RIWAMA’s sole administrator, Bro. Felix Obuah, warned people of the state against converting the sanitation hours of 7am to 10am into street trading, footballing and other social activities.
Bro. Obuah in a statement said such behavior is not only condemnable but grossly unpatriotic, urging those who engage in the act to desist henceforth as defaulters will be arrested and prosecuted.
He noted that the statewide sanitation exercise is a civic duty which entails the participation of all well-meaning people of the State for the overall health and cleanliness of the environment.
Sanitation Marshalls
The Sole Administrator warned that Sanitation Marshalls in conjunction with law enforcement agencies have been directed to monitor the roads and streets with a view to arresting and prosecuting those who engage in this unwholesome act, adding that to be forewarned is to be forearmed.
He therefore charged parents and guardians to call their children to order as those who flout the sanitation rules would be arrested and brought before the Sanitation Court for immediate prosecution.
The RIWAMA Sole Administrator stated that the full participation of all residents including youths in the State is solicited so as to engender a clean and healthy environment, stressing that using sanitation hours for street trading and footballing is tantamount to sabotaging the efforts of the Rivers State government.
