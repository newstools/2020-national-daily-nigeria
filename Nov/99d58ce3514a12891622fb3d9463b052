The remains of former Governor Balarabe Musa of old Kaduna State was laid to rest on Wednesday evening in accordance with Islamic injunctions in Kaduna.
The remains of the late Kaduna Governor arrived the Sultan Bello Mosque for prayers before he was committed to mother earth in his final journey to the world beyond.
Two former governors of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Makarfi and Ramalan Yero were present at the burial rites of Balarabe Musa.
Governor Nasir El-Rufai was absent at the burial; he was, however, represented by the Secretary to Kaduna State Government, Balarabe Abbass. El-Rufai was said to have traveled out of the state at the time of the death and burial of the former governor.
Late Balarabe Musa passed on in the early hours of Wednesday at the age of 85 years. He was a political pupil of late Alhaji Aminu Kano, leader of the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) in the first republic 1960 to 1966, which transformed into the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in the second republic 1979 to 1983. The political platform at all time was remarkable for progressivism and welfarist governance.
The late elder statesman was renowned for nationalism and patriotism in politics. He was impeached under controversial in 1979 by the Kaduna State House of Assembly dominated by members of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in desperate pressure to root out the PRP progressive structure from the governance of the state.
