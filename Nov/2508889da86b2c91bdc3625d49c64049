Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is intending to end payment of pension that Pulbic Office Holders Law 2007 provides for former governors and their deputies in the state.
He said this Tuesday while presenting the 2021 budget to the Lagos State House of Assembly.
“Mr. Speaker and Honourable Members of the House, in light of keeping the costs of governance low and to signal selflessness in public service, we will be sending a draft executive bill to the House imminently for the repeal of the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension Law 2007), which provides for payment of pension and other entitlements to former Governors and their Deputies.”
According to the law, the governor is entitled to N30 million pension annually, a house in Lagos and Abuja, six brand new cars every three years, medical allowances in any part of the world and other allowances.
The repeal of the law, if it succeeds, will affect Sanwo-Olu’s godfather and APC strongman Bola Tinubu, Works Minister Babtunde Fashola, Akinwunmi Ambode, and their deputies.
