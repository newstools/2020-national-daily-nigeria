Lesbianism is beginning to penetrate some local communities in Nigeria. Elders in certain communities now give consent to same sex marriage in their domain. Accordingly, certain community leaders were said to have presided over lesbian marriage involving two ladies, that appeared to be ‘traditional marriage’ last weekend in Ogun State, southwest, Nigeria.
Two ladies were involved in the marriage as husband and wife. They were said to have maintained long time lesbian relationship in the community before the formal marriage presided over by the elders in the community.
Same sex marriage or relationship has been a controversial issue in Nigeria. The country’s legislature rejected the recognition or enactment into law of gay or lesbianism, describing it inconsistent with African culture and, therefore, unacceptable.
