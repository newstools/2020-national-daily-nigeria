The Canadian Government has given more clarification on its refugee and immigration application process for people from Nigerians and other countries wanting to seek asylum in the country.
In a statement, the Canadian Government said its Embassies, High Commissions, Consulates, Consulates-General or Honorary Consulates, do not accept refugee applications directly from people.
It stated that Canada only works with the United Nations Refugee Agency, other designated referral organizations and private sponsors to identify individuals who need resettlement outside of their home country.
This disclosure was contained in a statement issued by the Canadian High Commission in Nigeria on Wednesday, November 11, 2020.
The Commission said that the notice was important in light of recent great interest in Canadian immigration programmes, pointing out that no one could guarantee approval of immigration applications except Canadian migration officers.
The statement from the Canadian High Commission in Nigeria which is titled, “A message from the Government of Canada,” reads, “Canadian Embassies, High Commissions, Consulates, Consulates-General or Honorary Consulates do not accept refugee applications directly from people.
“Canada works with the United Nations Refugee Agency, other designated referral organizations and private sponsors to identify individuals in need of resettlement, and who are outside their home country. You cannot apply directly for resettlement. You must be referred to Canada by a designated referral organization or a private sponsor.
“No one can guarantee that your immigration application will be fast-tracked or approved. Only a Canadian migration officer can decide if you can come to Canada. All the information you need to apply to visit or immigrate to Canada is available free on the official Government of Canada website.”
