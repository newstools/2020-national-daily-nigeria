FOLLOWING plans by GTBank to de-register itself as a public limited liability company and re-registering itself as a private limited liability company and a financial holding company, Innoson Nig Ltd, as its creditor, has dragged GTB to a Federal high Court seeking payment of a N32Billion Judgement debt.
It would be recalled that the Supreme Court of Nigeria has struck out GTB’s motion filed to set aside its earlier decision/order made on 27th February 2019 dismissing GTB’s against Court of Appeal judgement of 6th February 2014 in favor of Innoson Nigeria Ltd
Recall that The Federal High Court, Awka Division on March 27th, 2019, pursuant to Supreme Court dismissing GTB’s appeal, granted leave to Innoson Nigeria Ltd to enforce and execute the judgment and Garnishee Order Absolute made by the court coram Shakarho, J at the Ibadan Judicial Division on the 18th of May 2010 and the 29th of July 2011 respectively.
This order was concurrently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in the judgment of 6th February 2014 and by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 27th February 2019.
Whilst refusing GTB’s application and staying further proceedings the court further held that the order it made on March 27th, 2019 in favor of Innoson Nigeria Ltd granting it leave to enforce the judgment and issue processes of execution of the judgment are valid; also that all the steps taken to levy executions in pursuance of that order are still valid and are not vacated; whilst all the prayers by GTB in its motion of 1st April 2019 are not granted.
GTB however rushed back to the Supreme Court and applied for an order setting aside the Supreme Court’s judgement dismissing its appeal against the above judgement. However, the Supreme Court struck out the motion on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020.
While Innoson Nig Ltd awaits GTB to come up with a payment plan for it’s over N32 billion Judgement debt, GTB resorted to a scheme of de-registering itself as a public limited liability company and re-registering itself as a private limited liability company and a financial holding company as well.
In the new suit, Innoson motors, among many other demands is asking the court to restrain the Corporate Affairs Commission who is the 4th defendant from deregistering the 1st Defendant (GTB) as a public limited liability company and or re-registering the 1st Defendant (GTB) as a private limited liability until GTBank- pays the UC outstanding judgment debt of N32, 875, 204, 984.38k arising from Suit Nos: FHC/L/CS/603/2006 and No. FHC/AWK/CS/139/2012 respectively affirmed by the appellate courts in appeal Nos. CA/1/258/2011, SC.694/2014 and CA /E/288/2013 to Innoson Nig Ltd.
