A second republic Kaduna Gov Balarabe Musa has died.
Musa was among the crop of leftist politicians that shook the north in the second republic, under the leadership of the Aminu Kano, founder of the People Redemption Party.
Musa held office from October 1979 until he was impeached on 23 June, 1981.
He and other left-over of the left teamed up three years ago to revived the moribund party.
Born 21 August 1936, the elder statesman died in Kaduna at 84.
