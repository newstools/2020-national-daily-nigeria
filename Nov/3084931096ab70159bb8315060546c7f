Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State on Friday disclosed the initiatives to abolish pension for former governors and deputy governors in the state.
In a statement in Ilorin by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, Governor Abdulrazaq’s indicated that he will send a bill to the Kwara State House of Assembly next week, requesting the lawmakers to immediately repeal the law authorizing the payment of pension to former governors and deputies in the state.
The CPS explained that the governor’s decision was in line with his campaign mantra and proof that he recognised himself as a product of democracy.
“The governor has listened to voices of the majority of the citizens opposing the pension law for former governors and deputy governors.
“As representatives of the people, the lawmakers would exercise their discretion to call a public hearing on the topic to further harvest wider opinions on the topic,” Ajakaye said.
He added, “However, the governor feels it is time for the law as it is to give way. He would rather the state commits the scarce public funds to tackling the question of poverty and youth unemployment.”
