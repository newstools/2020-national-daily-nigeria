After two protesters died in Peru following the unpopular impeachment of its president, Manuel Merino, the new president, has resigned.
The protest erupted after the sudden impeachment of Merino’s predecessor, Martin Vizcarra, and protesters were calling for resignation of the Merino, the nation’s Congress topmost leader who was sworn in as president.
Peru’s legislators voted to remove their former president, Vizcarra, and then swore in Merino on Tuesday.
But the uproar underlined the illegitimacy of Merino’s power grab.
“I present my irrevocable resignation. I call for peace and unity of all Peruvians.”
An interim president will be announced November 16 to avoid a power vacuum.
