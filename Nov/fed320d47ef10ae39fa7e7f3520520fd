Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State on Tuesday refuted insinuations that he defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the party’s presidential ticket in 2023.
The governor battling with the unpopularity of his defection to APC from PDP on Tuesday, protested that the insinuation that he joined APC because of presidential ambition is nothing but false.
Governor Umahi said that he would quit politics by the end of his second term in office in 2023. “People can write all that they want to write, it is not my business. In 2023, if God permits, I will be quitting politics and I will be very satisfied because the miracles in Ebonyi State may just be the reason I was born in the first place.
“If people are shouting in this country about fairness, equity, and justice, and I stand in a place where such is not practice, then, I have to re-examine my head.
“Let it be known that I am God’s project, and I don’t go beyond the limit of my calling. I am satisfied being a governor and by His grace, for eight years,” Governor Umahi declared at a media briefing in Abakaliki.
At the briefing, the governor confirmed that he has moved to the ruling party, bringing an end to the speculations about his defection.
Governor Umahi was of the belief that his defection will expose the PDP to its mistakes and make corrections where necessary.
“I refuse to be called a politician because if politics is all about lying, cheating, and backstabbing, that is not my family character.
“So, I protest and nothing will stop me from this protest and I believe that this movement will cause PDP to understand that no man is an island and no single person can be called a crowd,” Umahi said.
