Joe Biden of the US Democratic Party and his running mate,  Senator Jamal’s Harris on Saturday set new records in the history of presidential elections in the country.

Biden,  77 is the oldest American to be elected President after winning a decisive battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday.

He thus clinched 273 electoral college votes, three more than he needed to win the presidency.

The AP gave him 284 votes, after calling Arizona.


Making history with him is his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, an African Asian American, who has become the first woman of colour to be elected as vice-president.

It was a stark contrast to Trump, who up till Saturday was still trying to discredit the US democracy, by alleging vote counting fraud.
