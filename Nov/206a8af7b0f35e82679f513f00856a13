Femi Fani-Kayode has lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari and military forces in Nigeria after the US Army rescued a US citizen in the Northern part of Nigeria after being held as hostage at the weekend.
The US Special Forces in the early hours of Saturday planned a sting operation which saw them rescuing an American, 27-year-old Philip Walton, taken hostage in Nigeria by armed men.
Walton was moved to northern Nigeria where he was held and the Pentagon has confirmed that the operation was executed on Saturday.
Reacting, the former Minister of Aviation, mocked the Buhari government, accusing it of being good at killing its own citizens, alluding to the shooting of unarmed #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki area of Lagos State.
“U.S. forces rescued an American citizen held hostage in Nigeria yesterday. 6 captors were killed by the Americans.
“Congrats to @realDonaldTrump! The @HQNigerianArmy is only good at killing its own citizens and the Nigerian President is only good at ordering them to do so. Shame on you!” The PDP chieftain tweeted.
