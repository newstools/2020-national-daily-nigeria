The widow of Ifeanyi Okereke, a vendor killed by a security aide to Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, has disagreed with her in-laws who recently hired rights lawyer Mike Ozekhome to demand N500m in damages from the Speaker.
All Josephine wants is the fulfilment of the promised the No 4 citizen made her—to take care of her two children.
She spoke at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday when she urged the Speaker to ignore the family and their lawyer, saying she was not aware of the pre-litigation process.
The family of Ifeanyichukwu Okereke had written to Gbajabiamila, demanding N500m.
Ozekhome, in a letter dated November 23, 2020, said he had the family’s instruction to sue Gbjabiamila if he failed to make half a billion naira available in seven days.
The family insist no amount of money can bring back their dead son.
