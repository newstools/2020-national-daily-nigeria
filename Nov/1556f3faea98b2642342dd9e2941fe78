The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Tuesday allayed the fear of petrol scarcity in the country. The Corporation assured  that the threat action as a result  of the dispute between the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association (PENGASSAN) and the federal government over the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) will not obstruct the supply of petrol across the country.
NNPC in  statement by the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Kennie Obateru, citted the Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, to have assured  that the industrial action embarked upon by PENGASSAN would not lead to scarcity of petroleum products, adding that all fuel stations and petrol depots in the country have sufficient stock.
Kyari insisted that NNPC has over 2.9 billion litres of petrol in stock to guarantee the movement of people, goods and services across the country during the Christmas season and beyond.
Kyari maintained that NNPC is determined to ensure there is no petrol scarcity in the 2020 end-of-year celebrations. He guaranteed that critical stockholders in the petroleum products supply and distribution chains, like tanker drivers, depot owners and road transport owners have been mobilized to ensure hitch-free season of petrol supply.
There has been insinuations of petrol scarcity following the commencement of national strike by PENGASSAN, leading to panic buying and stockpiling of petrol.
