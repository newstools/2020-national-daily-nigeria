Former Senator from Kaduna State, Shehu Sani, on Friday reacted to the rigging allegation trailing the ongoing presidential election.


It would be recalled that Donald Trump, the incumbent president and candidate of the Republic Party had raised the allegation of rigging in favour of Joe Biden,  the Democratic presidential candidate.

In his address to the nation on Thursday, Trump had claimed he was hearing “horror stories” of Democrats manipulating the exercise, especially via mail-in ballots.


Reacting on his verified twitter account,  Sani said the ongoing presidential election has exposed the vulnerability of the US democracy.

“American model of democracy has been a reference point for standard, order and responsibility. It has been an example for freedom and good conduct.

“We all now know about its imperfections and vulnerabilities. Like in everything else, pick the good and take lessons from the bad.”
