Former Governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel has revealed what the incumbent governor of the state earns as salary as well as what other former governors of the state, including himself earn monthly as pension.
Otunba Daniel said anybody who rules the state as governor receives N500,000 as monthly salary, and after his tenure, will continue receiving the same amount as his pension.
Otunba Daniel, who ruled Ogun State from 2003 to 2011, was succeeded by Sen. Amosun, who later handed over to the incumbent Gov Abiodun in 2019.
The former governor revealed in a viral video that what obtains in Ogun State is different from some states where former governors get houses in Abuja, among other entitlements.
According to him, this he claimed is too much for a former governor as he called for a cut in salaries of political office holders.
Otunba Daniels, speaking on his entitlements as former governor on a Yoruba interview, confirmed that he still receives N500,000 as his pension. However, he said neither Amosun nor Abiodun has deemed it fit to buy him a car since he left office in 2011.
“Most of the things happening at the National Assembly are not too bearable anymore, especially the money they receive. They should cut it.” Daniel said.
When asked if the same should apply to those in the executive arm, especially the state governors, Daniel replied: “I don’t know how much other state governors receive monthly, but in Ogun State, it is N500,000 per month.
“I heard there are some states that pay a lot of money as pension to their former governors. In Ogun State, we receive the same N500,000 as ex-governors. They said some states do build houses and buy cars for their former governors. Since I left office, nobody has bought a car for me.”
