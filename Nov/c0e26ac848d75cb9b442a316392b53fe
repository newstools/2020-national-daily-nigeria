seeks Prosecution Of Alleged Culprit

The Lagos State House of Assembly has called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the state to direct the State’s Commissioner For Justice and Attorney General, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo to prosecute Mr. Ben Emmanuel who attacked an  official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Ismaila Lukman at Jakande junction in Lekki on Sunday.

Hon. Temitope Adewale, representing Ifako-Ijaiye Constituency 1 raised this under matter of urgent public importance at plenary on Tuesday.

The lawmaker, who is the Chairman House Committee on Transportation outrightly condemned the incessant attack on LASTMA officials and others.

He condemned all attacks on LASTMA officials and called on Babajide Sanwo-Olu to direct the Commissioner For Information and Strategy to sentisitise Lagosians on the need to protect LASTMA officers, while performing their duties.

According to him, It has become the attitude of motorists to attack LASTMA officials.

It will be recalled that a LASTMA official, Mr. Ismaila Lukman was attacked for advising Mr. Emmanuel to utilise the footbridge after he was approached to stop traffic for pedestrians at the traffic lights that had been damaged by hoodlums during the violent #EndSARS protests in Lagos.

In his contribution, Hon. Rotimi Olowo representing Shomolu 1 quoted Section (24c) as amended said that it shall be the duty of all citizens to live in harmony with one another.

The Deputy Majority Leader of the House, Hon. Noheem Adams, representing Eti Osa 1 said that the motion was important and that LASTMA was established by former governor Bola Tinubu to direct and manage traffic in the State.

The lawmaker also supported his colleague that the culprit should be prosecuted.

In the same vein, Hon. Victor Akande (Ojo1), said that it was the duty of the State to protect lives and properties, saying that it was time to look into the law and protect the officials and act on it.

The Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa said, “as we are quick to prosecute LASTMA officials, who misbehave, we must be quicker to prosecute those found culpable of attacking LASTMA officials.”

The House therefore urged Moyosore Onigbanjo to speed up the prosecution of Mr. Ben Emmanuel to serve as a deterrent to others.Attack On LASTMA Official: Lagos Assembly Seeks Prosecution Of Alleged Culprit
