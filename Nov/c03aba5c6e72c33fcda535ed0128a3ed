Senator Shehu Sani has scolded northern governors over their misplaced concerns for the north in fighting for censorship of social media in the country. The former senators from Kaduna State blasted the northern governors for not considering serious problems in the north which include killings by terrorists and bandits, rape of women, invasion of communities, among others, and dissipating so much energy on social media censorship.
Shehu Sani in a tweet @ShehuSani wrote: “Northern governors, their kinsmen are being slaughtered daily by bandits and insurgents; their people are daily kidnapped and impoverished by ransom, their women are raped and their villages are under siege. Their people live in fear and funerals. Yet, social media is their problem.”
