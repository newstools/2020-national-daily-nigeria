The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has advised the Governor of Rivers state to handle the alleged killings in Oyigbo with extreme care to forestall escalation, and also avoid generalizing his anger towards Igbo race.
Chairman of CAN, Anambra Chapter, Rev. Dr. Ndubuisi John who gave the advice on Thursday in Onitsha in a press briefing, said not everybody in Igbo land is a member, and therefore his attack on every Igbo man is totally wrong.
The cleric who described the killings as dehumanizing and called on Church leaders to assist in dousing the situation, urged the governor to avoid generalizing his anger towards Igbo race, but rather govern with the wisdom of God as the Shepherd of the State.
The cleric also cautioned the youths to listen to the advice of their elders and religious leaders, noting that advice from such personalities would never be destructive.
He said, “Youths should lay down their arms and come down to round table conferences so that we can discuss and know how to manage the issue.
“The Governor can’t generalize his anger towards Igbo race, it is absolutely wrong. He should behave maturely, because as a Governor and a person, we respect and adore his office and we expect him to also act as a Governor with mercy”.
He described the #EndSARS protest as backup grievances against government and explosion occasioned by sufferings, Ndubisi commiserated with victims of the protest that included the dead, the living and the injured.
“No doubt the protest was a fallout of prolonged anger; people have been dying in silence until now. But the killings are not palatable especially as people are gradually recovering from protest,” the cleric added.
