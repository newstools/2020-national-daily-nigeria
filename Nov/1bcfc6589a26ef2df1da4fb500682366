A former Inspector General of Police, Tafa Balogun, on Thursday urged policemen to return to their duty posts across the country.
Balogun in a statement on Thursday, told police officers to put the experiences of the #EndSARS protests and violence behind them and forge ahead because their concerns are currently being handled by police authorities and the federal government.
“I urge all members of the Nigeria Police in our country to return to their duty posts and continue to provide the much needed security to our dear country, Nigeria, not minding the recent brutal attacks, arson, and acts of intimidation against the Police.
“The Nigeria Police remain the first line of Internal Security as guaranteed by the Nigerian Constitution. Therefore, it behooves all and sundry to support the institution,” Balogun said.
Police personnel have been off the streets since the #EndSARS violent protests and attacks on police officers and facilities.
