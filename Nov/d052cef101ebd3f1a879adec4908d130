Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Bode George has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to be wary of Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and those trying to market the APC Chieftain to him ahead of the 2023 general elections.
He made the call while condemning the recent visit of some APC chieftains, Chief Bisi Akande, Prince Tajudeen Olusi, Dr. Yomi Finnih, and Chief Segun Osoba to the State House, Abuja.
He cautioned Buhari against falling to the antics of those who would ignore the issues of Lagos State to engage in a needless scheming in partisan engagement.
Bode-George made the call in his statement titled, “The jamboree visit to the Villa: My Birthday Offering.”
The PDP chieftain said: “The visit of Chief Bisi Akande, Prince Tajudeen Olusi, Dr. Yomi Finnih, and Chief Segun Osoba to the seat of power in Abuja is needless, unnecessary, veiled in some poorly hidden agenda that is woven in apparently self-serving ulterior personalised desperation.
“It is easy to discern that the visit is stripped of any patriotic progression, lacking in balanced national leadership, voided of a spirit of sacrifice and developmental vision.
“The very absence of Bola Tinubu from the jamboree screams to high heavens that the meeting itself is a covert placatory softening of the ground for Tinubu himself.
“I am pretty certain that in his very absence, Tinubu occupies the centrality of the discussion. I will advise Baba Akande who governed Osun State with principled, incorruptible leadership to kindly help us drop off Bola Tinubu at Iragbiji as he makes his way back to Ila-Orangun, rather than engaging in fruitless pleading sessions for a man who is fixated on a warped pipe-dream about governing Nigeria. He should pay restitution for the egregious stripping of the Lagosian coffers.”
