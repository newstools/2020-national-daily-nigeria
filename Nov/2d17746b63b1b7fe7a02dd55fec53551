Senator Ali Ndume, representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, on Sunday said that members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) appointed into the government by President Muhammadu Buhari are betraying the president in policy implementation. Ndume on Channels TV programme on Sunday insisted that President Buhari is being betrayed by some kleptocrats in his government, who are also APC members.
“The president is a genuine person that has the interest of the common man at heart.
“He has integrity and the competence but unfortunately, the kleptocrats in the government have formed the majority and, therefore, betraying the laudable policies that the president wants to implement,” Ndume said.
The senator pointed out that Buhari predicated his administration on three major agenda, namely, security, fight against corruption, and provision of infrastructure, saying that the President has performed on all the policy thrusts.
Ndume decried that the president encounters obstacle in the implementation of some policies, which he said causes problems in the development of the country.
Ndume stated that President Buhari cannot perform the public functions himself, and, therefore, he has to appoint individuals to perform in various capacities. The senator lamented that some of the political appointees have failed to deliver on their jobs.
Perhaps, Ndume was convinced on the need for cabinet reshuffle by the president.
