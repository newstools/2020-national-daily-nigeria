The controversy over the US presidential election persists. Incumbent President Donald Trump, candidate of the Republican Party,  had on Friday cautioned Joe Biden, candidate of the Democratic Party,  to desist from “wrongfully claim” of the US President, noting that the electoral process is still incomplete and legal proceedings just commencing.
President Trump on his twitter handle @realDonaldTrump wrote: “Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!”
Trump further tweeted: Donald J. Trump
@realDonaldTrump: “I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!”
Meanwhile, result of the presidential election is being awaited from states identified as battle states which include Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, etc.
