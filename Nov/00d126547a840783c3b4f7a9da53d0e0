The six governors from the South-south geopolitical zone and other important personalities from the Niger Delta region have expressed their anger at the Presidency for failing to attend a major stakeholdersâ€™ meeting scheduled in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, on Tuesday.
It was gathered that the meeting was convened at the instance of the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari, to discuss the emerging threats to the peace in the Niger Delta region.
A source and aide to one of the governors said the meeting was arranged days before Tuesday and wondered why the Presidency chose to treat such crucial gathering with levity.
