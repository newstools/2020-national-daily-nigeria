APC Senator Ali Nndume has been ordered into remand pending the sale of a N500m piece of property he guaranteed while standing in as a surety for fugitive Abdulrasheed Maina standing trial before an Abuja high court.
The court presided over by Justice Okon Abang gave out the order on Nov 23.
Maina, who headed the defuct Pension Reform Task Team, mismanaged N2bn, and he is being prosecuted by the EFCC, though he has juped bail now.
Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday ordered the remand of Senator Ali Ndume over his inability to produce former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, who has jumped bail in respect of his ongoing N2bn money laundering trial.
Abang said Ndume would only be released from prison until he either produces Maina in court or sells off the N500m worth of property located in Asokoro, Abuja, which was used as the guarantee for the bail bond and tenders the evidence of the payment of the proceeds of the sale into the Federation Account.
Ndume is going to Kuje prison pending when he meets the condition for release.
