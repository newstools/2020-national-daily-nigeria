Brig.-Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, commande, 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, has appeared before the Justice Doris Obiokwu Panel of Inquiry in Lagos, and clarified issues around one of ENDSARS protester Obiannu Catherin Udeh called DJ Switch who claimed to have witnessed the shooting that killed 15 protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20.
The lady has claimed the Nigerian government is after her, and international communities, including the Canadian Parliament, are giving her audience.
But Taiwo said her testimony is far from the truth.
“Some people take delight in misrepresenting Nigeria and particularly the Nigerian Army to the international community and our fellow Nigerians. This, I believe is done for pecuniary gains,” Taiwo before the panel on Nov 14.
“Quite recently, a Nigerian, Catherine Udeh, also known as DJ Switch, claimed the Nigerian Army was looking for her. There is nothing further than the truth.
“My Lord, we have bigger fish to fry; and that is how to stabilise Lagos. We can’t be bothered chasing one or two people. Where she got that from, I do not know.”
The brigadier might be alluding to media stories about DJ switch seeking asylum in Canada.
