Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu has dismissed as unnecessary the uproar that followed the freezing of accounts of companies and individuals that featured in the weeks-long ENDSARS protest that rocked Nigeria in October.
The Ondo governor, a senior advocate of Nigeria, sees nothing wrong about the action of the Central Bank of Nigeria in seeking a court order for freezing the account.
“If for instance, my account was frozen, what would I do? All I would do is go back to court to explain,” he said on Channels TV on Wednesday.
“Even politicians, their accounts are sometimes frozen. You have to go to court and explain. And at the end of the day, the court will say, leave the account, the account should be de-frozen and you take your money back.”
He urged those affected to justify why the money was there. 
“You come to explain to what use you have put this money.”
The federal government decision has affected many of the youth reps on the judicial panels states set up to investigate the violent activities of the SARS unit of the Nigeria police before President Muhammadu Buhari scrapped it in October.
