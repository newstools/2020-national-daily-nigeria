The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has constituted a Caretaker Committee in Ebonyi State to superintend the activities of the party in the state.

5. Mrs. Amaka Igboke – Women Leader
6. Barr Mudi Irenede – Legal Adviser
7. Barr. Ibeshi          – Youth Leader
“The decision of the NWC in this regard is pursuant to the powers conferred on it by the provisions of the PDP Constitution (2017 as amended).
“All our leaders, members and teeming supporters in Ebonyi state and the southeast are by this guided accordingly,” National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan declared.
The PDP subsequently expanded the Ebonyi State Caretaker Committee.
Again, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in another statement disclosed that the National Working Committee (NWC) approved the expansion of the newly constituted Ebonyi State caretaker committee.
