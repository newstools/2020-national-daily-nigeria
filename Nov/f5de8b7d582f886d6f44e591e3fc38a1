The federal government has denied placing a travel ban on known faces that participated in the #EndSARS, describing the report as fake news.
An online media platform had earlier on Tuesday morning reported that the Ministry of Interior had requested from the Department of State Security (DSS) whether or not it had a profile on key supporters of the #EndSARS protests.
The media report claimed that a list has been formally circulated, and six people suspected of taking part in the #EndSARS protests were prevented from travelling last week.
But reacting to the report, the Ministry of Interior said it did not generate a ‘no-fly’ list and that reports of #EndSARS protesters getting their passports seized due to a travel ban is fake news.
The Ministry dismissed the report as fake news using its Twitter handle to reiterate, “The Ministry of Interior did not, has not, and will not generate any no-fly list. Ignore fake news please!”
