Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday paid tribute to the late former Governor of Kaduna State, Alh. Balarabe Musa, describing him as a patriot whose death was received with deep shock.
Dr. Obasanjo in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, emphasized that late Balarabe Musa had an unwavering belief in a greater Nigeria.
Dr. Obasanjo maintained: “He accordingly gave the best of his remarkable talent and ability in pursuit of this goal.”
The former President recalled that the late Musa became the first civilian Governor of Kaduna State in 1979 and re-affirmed himself as one of Nigeria’s most articulate Governors at the time but was impeached by the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) which dominated the Kaduna State House of Assembly.
“Despite his latter impeachment as the Governor of Kaduna State in 1981, he contested an elective office for the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) where he ran as Presidential Candidate in the 2003 election which, unfortunately, he lost.
“The late Alhaji Balarabe Musa will be remembered for his invaluable contribution to Nigeria’s political evolution.
“He brought renewed activism, verve and resourcefulness to bear on the nation’s polity,” Dr. Obasanjo declared.
