The Special Military Task Force, Code named Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), saddled with the responsibility to maintain peace in Plateau State, has raided criminal hideouts in the bid to rid the State of criminal elements especially as Plateau prepares to host the National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST).

NAFEST scheduled for 23 to 28 of November 2020 is expected to gather all lovers of Arts and Culture across the country to converge in Jos.

Determined to have a hitch free celebration, Commander of the Force,
Maj. Gen. Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, said the OPSH will ensure criminals will have no hiding place, hence troops moved to fish out cultists, and other criminals numbering 27.

Okonkwo said there has also been an upsurge in cultists activities in the State, an act which also involved women as syndicates.

He said during the raid, drug barons were also arrested but have been handed over to the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).

He warned that he will not allow criminal elements to also take advantage of the fourth coming yuletide season to rain terror in Plateau.

“We shall remain resolute to our mandate of restoration and maintenance of peace and shall continue to get rid of kidnappers, cultists and other enemies of the State. There shall be no hiding place for kidnappers and other criminally minded people this time around he said”, Okonkwo said.
