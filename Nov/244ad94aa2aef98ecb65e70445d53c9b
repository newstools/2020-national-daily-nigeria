Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, says the conspiracy against the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, by some politicians in the southwest was part of strategies to divide and create confusion among the Yoruba people.
He said the Southwest people would resist any attempts to ridicule Tinubu, whom he described as the image of Yoruba nation, noting that any attack against the former Lagos State Governor is an attack on the entire Yoruba people.
The PDP chieftain who spoke at his Afao-Ekiti country home in Ekiti State, noted that some politicians nurtured to political stardom by Tinubu are behind his travails on account of personal interest.
He stated that the former Lagos state governor does not deserve to be crucified by his political mentees, saying he had sacrificed enormously to groom and raise them from political obscurity to limelight.
Fayose said he would never associate nor join the group of rebels to destroy Tinubu because the APC leader laboured for the country through his focused leadership which stimulated the growth of Yoruba socio-political space with some southwest politicians now occupying vantage leadership positions across in the country.
“I am not championing the course of Tinubu. I am not in the position to do that, but there is no denying the fact that Tinubu is a prominent Yoruba leader, whether in APC or in PDP. Fayose is a prominent son of Yoruba nation.
“For me, Tinubu has paid his dues, I stand by that. I have not seen Tinubu after the Ekiti election by any means. We haven’t even met at a function or see him passed. I will not sit down in any corner to shoot down Tinubu. I am not a member of APC and I will never be. But I supported Governor Fayemi to be governor by Tinubu’s influence at a time,” he said.
