Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu has hit his tribesmen clamouring for an Igbo presidency in 2023, telling them to forget it.
He warned them too not to take themselves seriously with restructuring.
The southeast and their sympathisers across Nigeria have insisted it’s their turn to occupy the nation’s topmost office.
But Kalu, speaking in Umuahia Thursday, said he earlier made a case for an Igbo president, but nobody—not even the Igbo highest cultural body Ohaneze—took him seriously.
According to him, when it’s time, the south east will have what it desires.
His ruling party APC is under pressure to tip the scale in favour  of the south—the southwest, the southeast, and the south-south—in 2023.
And the aspirants many Nigerians are watching in the west apparently look more prepared to put up a fight for the APC presidential ticket—unlike the  southeast which has yet to get its act together.
The PDP, the main opposition, is preoccupied with getting back to power, and won’t mind breaking its own gentleman’s agreement of rotational presidency.
The party’s strongest suit remains Atiku Abubakar, a northerner   and veteran presidential contestant who may snag the ticket again in 2023.
