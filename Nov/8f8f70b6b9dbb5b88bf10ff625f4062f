The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has berated President Muhammadu Buhari and All Progressives Congress (APC) over failed policies and worsening insecurity, economy and corruption in Nigeria.
The PDP in a statement by National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, was of the view that the “Buhari-led government is also using the increase of the pump price of petrol to also distract the nation from the Saturday’s abduction of children in Zaria, Kaduna State, by gunmen, who had scaled up attack on Nigerians.”
The PDP was also of the view that the APC was seeking to divert attention from its failures and the reported involvement of top officials of its government in the looting spree, by engaging in a smear campaign, distortions, and wild goose chase on issues that are of no relevance to national development.
PDP advised the National Caretaker Committee of APC “to address the crisis in the party instead of seeking consultancy job in other political parties and focus on governing the country.”
The party maintained that the country has gone worse under the APC government.
