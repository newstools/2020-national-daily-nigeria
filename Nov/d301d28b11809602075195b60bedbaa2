Politicians from the Southeastern part of the country, say they are perfecting plans on how to make sure somebody from the region ascends the presidency of the country come 2023.
According to the region’s apex socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Southeast zone is not relenting in getting the presidential ticket in 2023, and has put measures in place to make it a reality.
The group says part of its strategy is the planned letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to that effect.
Ohanaeze maintained the two top political parties should cede their presidential tickets to the Southeast.
Similarly, Chairman of Igbo World Assembly IWA and Ohanaeze Chairman Overseas, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze, in Awka on Sunday said that Igbo were ready to make 2023 a reality.
He said the zone had all it takes to make Nigeria great again, adding Ohanaeze was working in tandem with the other ethnic groups in the country to make it work.
He said Ohanaeze was working with ‘Who is who ‘in Igbo land on the project with other eggheads from other zones.
He maintained that what Nigeria needed in the long run was true federalism which, according to him, was a system of government based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern was shared between National and regional governments.
“The individual federating units need to have more control over their own affairs. The federal government should control issues in the single exclusive list. We are serious about this project. In Overseas, Ndigbo see it as a major thing including other sections in this country.
“If you look very well, you will notice that only the Southeast has not produced the president of Nigeria,” Anakwenze said.
On whether IWA -Ohanaeze had some people in mind to replace Buhari if eventually Igbo gets the ticket, Anakwenze said there were many leaders in the region.
