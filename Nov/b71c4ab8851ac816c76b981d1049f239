Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle may be the next PDP governor striking out of the party to join the APC.
The auguries are unmistakable.
Besides the alert PDP Governor Nyesom Wike raised of another governor following Ebonyi Gov Dave Umahi to the ruling APC, the praise of Umahi’s decision which Mattawale just sang make it clearer Zamfara will soon become an APC state.
Matawalle’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Zailani Baffa, on Friday, said his boss has rather commended Governor Umahi for his bold decision because everyone feels welcome only in a house where he feels comfortable
Matawalle is complaining of “bad blood in the PDP” being responsible for Umahi’s defection to the APC.
“If this trend of generating bad blood amongst us continues unabated, our great party will increasingly be on the receiving end as we move towards the year 2023. I am having a very bad experience of late from some of my PDP governor colleagues, which I still find very puzzling.”
Umahi complained of high handedness by some governors in the PDP, contrary to what Wike said—2023 presidency—was the reason Umahi cross-carpeted.
Matawalle’s complaint too may just excite the APC which initially won the states guber election before the Supreme Court overturned it.
