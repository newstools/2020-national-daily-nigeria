The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), said that the corps will introduce the National Identity Number (NIN) information by the first quarter of 2021 for vehicles registration, licence.
FRSC Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi who disclosed this in Abuja, said that the essence of the NIN was to enhance road safety through the use of technology.
He also said that from December, drivers licence would no longer be issued without the NIN information.
“You know before some people have about five different identities but now you are forced to pick one. Once you pick one with NIMC that is what you will be using because it is now going to be as from next month (December). It is going to be compulsory.
The FRSC boss explained that only the Vehicles Inspection Office (VIO) were authorised to test applicants before prescribed fees could be paid to the state government through their internal revenue service.
He added that the VIO would, in turn, refer applicants for capturing which would be transferred to the database of the country.
“A fake licence is N25,000 to N30,000, the original licence is N6,350 but I won’t blame them it is the ‘bigmanism’, people are not ready to follow the process and along the line too this NIN information for drivers licence the same thing will come on board before the end of the first quarter next year for vehicle registration.
“If you want to register your vehicle, it is going to be compulsory for you to provide your NIN with these are parts of the security checks. So once you provide your NIN, it makes the matter to be simpler.’’
He urged the country to take a cue from China and other developed countries that made use of technology to fight crime.
He commended the security agencies for making use of their unrestricted access to the database in checking corrupt practices in the system.
