Former NSA Sambo Dasuki and ex-GM , the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Amniu Babkusa spent N2.2bn on prayer offered in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria to defeat Boko Haram.
That was the testimony of the EFCC witness and investigation officer Addariko Michael on Tuesday at a federal high court in Abuja.
Dasuki resumed his trial after he was released on bail last year, having been in detention since 2015.
Other entities involved in the alleged fraud are Acacia Holdings Limited and Reliance Referral Hospital Limited. Both were used in the diversion of over $2bn meant for the purchase of arms to fight insurgency in the N
The defendants are facing 32 counts bordering on misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, dishonest release and receiving various sums of money before Justice Husseini Baba-Yusuf.
Led in evidence by EFCC counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), Adariko said N650m was also transferred to Acacia Holding Limited’s account with EcoBank, while another N600m and N200m were transferred to the company’s account with UBA.
“Between September 27, 2013, and April 16, 2015, N50m was credited to Reliance Referral Hospital’s account.
“Based on responses from the banks involved, as investigating officer, we found out that money was transferred to several individuals and companies.
“When we went through the account statement, we asked the second defendant (Aminu Babakusa) the reason for this.
“He informed us that the money was used to hire clerics to pray for the nation as regards Boko Haram crisis.
“When we asked him to provide the names, contacts, and phone numbers of the clerics he hired to pray for the nation, he mentioned only two.”
After listening to the testimony, Justice Baba-Yusuf adjourned the matter until November 11 for the continuation of hearing.
