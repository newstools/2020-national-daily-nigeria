The 32-year-old medical doctor, Valentine Egbabon, treating the injured during the ENDSARS protest at Lekki has died of covid-19 at the Yaba COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit in Lagos.
Egbabon’s colleagues said he died on Monday after testing positive to the virus three weeks ago.
“Today is a sad day! My colleague and classmate @ehival lost his life after testing positive for COVID-19 three weeks ago. He was an active young man with beautiful family and a bright future ahead of him. May his soul rest in perfect peace. No one is safe”, Cassandra Akinde, Medical Doctor and Chevening Scholar tweeted on Monday.
Nonso Egembe, aka “Aproko doctor” also tweeted his tributes for the dead colleague.
“Rest in Peace, Dr Val COVID-19 took you from us but it can’t erase your memories. You were fit as a fiddle. You live on in our hearts. Rest on brother. Rest on”.
Dr. Olufunmilayo Harvey @Yourfaveonlinedoc, another medical doctor practicing in the United Kingdom also wrote on his Twitter timeline “A young medical doctor @ehival has died from COVID-19. This is very sad and heartbreaking. I just checked his page again now. He even used RIP Jimoh and #EndSARS as profile name. He believed in Nigeria. He wanted a better country. Today he is gone. May God comfort his family.”
Harvey also shared a compelling video of the late doctor speaking against the shooting of protesters by armed soldiers at the Lekki Toll Plaza on the 20th of October while another video of him treating an injured protester also surfaced online.
Covid-19 has been spiking the second time in Europe and north America, and WHO hs advised Nigeria and South Africa to beware of the second wave.
The NCDC authorities warned also that Nigerians will witness the consequences of poor social standing and other protocol violation during the weeks-long ENDSARS protest across the south.
