All the way from Singapore, the cybersecurity of the International Police, in conjunction with the unit in the National Bureau Centre, Abuja, intelligence report nailed three Nigerian cybercriminals who were taking into custody Thursday.
The police also said it uncovered over 50,000 email accounts and websites, including passwords of various individuals and corporate entities across the world.
The suspects are Chidiebere Onwuka, a.k.a Ceeceeboss TMT, 32; Ikechukwu Ohanedozie, a.k.a Dozzy, 34; and Ifeanyi Onuegwu, a.k.a SSGToolz, 35.
According to a statement on Thursday by the Force spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, findings revealed that Onuegwu specialised in creating, designing, selling of phishing links and hosting malwares on the website used by the gang for phishing and hacking purposes.
The suspect was also accused of collecting charges running into several millions of naira from other fraudsters he mentored and improved their phishing capabilities.
Mba said Onwuka, a graduate of Business Administration from the Imo State University, specialised in business email compromise and hacking.
“A comprehensive forensic analysis reveals that he had in his laptop over 50,000 email accounts and websites, including passwords of various individuals and corporate entities across the world.
“He recruited the third suspect, Ohanedozie, a medical student of the Imo State University, into the gang. Ohanedozie sorts and profiles e-mail accounts to determine the financial strengths of prospective victims and passes on information obtained there to Onwuka.
“All the suspects will be charged to court on conclusion of the investigation and prosecuted in line with the Cybercrime Prevention/Prohibition Act, 2015,” he added.
