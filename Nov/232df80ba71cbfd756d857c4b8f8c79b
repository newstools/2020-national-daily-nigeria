The crisis in Nigeria’s pharmacy chain – HealthPlus, took a different turn on Wednesday as Partners alleged to be Alta Semper PE, tried to take over the Head Office of HealthPlus in Lagos this morning.

This was disclosed in a video posted by TheCable this morning on social media with the caption, “despite court order, partner attempts to take over HealthPlus Ltd head office.”


The crisis started when Chidi Okoro was appointed as Chief Transformation Officer in September.

This appointment set off a chain of online and social media mudslinging, that has seen both sides court public sympathy for who is in control of the company.

The founder and ‘CEO’ of HealthPlus Ltd, Mrs. Bukky George issued a counter press release, denying that she had been removed as MD/CEO.

According to her side of the story, she claimed the press release was not authorized by the company and termed it false.

“We wish to inform the General Public, the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria, our Staff, loyal Customers, Vendors, Landlords, Bankers, and all Stakeholders, that the press release was NOT authorized by the company or anybody acting on its behalf, and that the announcement of the appointment of a CTO is wholly FALSE.”

HealthPlus said that its founder, Mrs. Bukky George, owns 48.9% of HealthPlus Africa Holdings and that she is the only Nigerian registered Pharmacist shareholder and director in the company.

HealthPlus also reported Alta Semper directors to the police in September, as observed in a document seen by Nairametrics.

In a letter sent to the Assistant Inspector General of Police on September 25, HealthPlus stated, “We had the presence of unknown persons around our head office locations.


“We are aware that there are unauthorized and illegal plans by certain persons to take over our company premises to steal sensitive company property and assets, and ultimately take over operations of the company.”
