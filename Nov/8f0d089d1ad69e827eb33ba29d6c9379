The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, on Thursday said that the real reason Governor Dave Umahi defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday will soon be exposed. He insisted that the PDP is still string in Ebonyi State and the southeast without Umahi, adding that the defection of the Ebonyi governors has changed nothing in the zone.
Secondus speaking at the 90th NEC meeting of the party in Abuja, acknowledged the defection of PDP Governor in Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, to the ruling APC on Tuesday and his provocative reason or allegation of injustice against South East by the party. He said the party cannot engage the exited governor on his statement but must resist any act of blackmail.
“We have refused to join issues with him in anyway, but we cannot bow to any blackmail. What I can report to NEC is that the strength of our party in Ebonyi State and South East is intact and the NWC has taken necessary steps to protect and guard it. “The real reason that informed this decision will soon be exposed,” the PDP National Chairman declared.
