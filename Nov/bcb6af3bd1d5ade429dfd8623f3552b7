It traded at N475 at the previous session, data from abokiFX, which collated data from street traders, showed and the decline meant naira lost 0.63% in value at the end of trade.
On Monday, it shed N5 on Monday when it closed at N470, meaning the naira has not gained any ground against the dollar so far this week.
