The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), has described the arrest and remand in prison of Senator Ali Ndume over the disappearance of  former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Force, Abdulrasheed Maina, who had jumped bail as unfair.
Recall that Justice Okon Abang of an Abuja Federal High Court, had given the order on Monday that Ndume, the Senator representing Borno South, should be remanded at the Kuje Correctional Reforms Centre after standing surety for Maina who has reportedly jumped bail by refusing to appear before the court leading to a revocation of his bail.
In a statement signed by its National President, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, AYCF wondered why the same court has “not ordered the detention of Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe who stood as surety for the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu, who also jumped bail and currently nowhere to be found.
“In the interest of equity, fairness and balance, Senator Abaribe should be immediately arrested and remanded in prison too until Kanu is turned in or he turns himself in.
“Both Ndume and Abaribe are senators in the country, so Abaribe cannot be said to be higher than Ndume. Both are lawmakers by the grace of our constitution and the votes of their constituents.
“It is the kind of development that gives people room to accuse the Federal Government of selective application of justice.
“We, therefore, call on President Buhari to intervene and put an end to this embarrassing selectivity against one of the North’s exceptionally vocal, fearless and pro-masses members of the National Assembly.”
Abaribe had filed a suit to discharge himself as a surety to Nnamdi Kanu. The court is yet to rule on his application.
