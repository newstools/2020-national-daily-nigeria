The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says the decision to freeze the accounts belonging to some #EndSARS promoters was because they may be linked to some terrorist activities.

This was contained in a written address in support of an ex parts motion filed by the CBN.

In the case with suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1384/2020, filed before Justice A. R. Mohammed, the CBN, however, did not mention that these 20 bank accounts were owned by individuals and organization that were involved in the #EndSARS protests, but told the court that the funds might have emanated from terrorist activities.

The written address partly reads, “My lord, the nature of the transactions undertaken through the defendants’ accounts are of suspected terrorism financing in contravention of Section 13(1)(a) and(b) of the Terrorism (Prevention)(Amendment) Act, 2013 and Regulation 31(2)(a) and (3)(b) of the Central Bank of Nigeria Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism Regulations, 2013.”


In a supporting affidavit deposed to by one Aondowase Jacob, on behalf of the CBN, it was stated that the Head of the Economic Intelligence Unit of the Governor’s Department, CBN, Joseph Omayuku, had conducted an investigation on the accounts of the defendants and other individuals and entities held with certain banks in Nigeria.

According to the affidavit, the investigation showed that the owners of the accounts may have been involved in terrorist activities.
