As electricity distribution companies in Nigeria roll out one million meters to households, President Muhammadu Buhari has insisted his government will end estimated metering very soon.
In a series of tweets he posted on his Twitter handle, @MBuhari, on Wednesday, Buhari said the government made money avaialable for the meter the discos are giving out freely now in the first phase.
The total number to be rolled out is 6.5 million meters nationwide.
“Under the first phase of the Presidential Mass Metering Initiative, we are making funding immediately available for DisCos to roll out 1,000,000 meters in the first phase, at no cost to consumers. Deployment has already started in parts of Kano, Kaduna, Lagos and Abuja,” he said.
“Future phases of this metering initiative will help us fully meet the 6.5 million deficit of meters nationwide and will impact an estimated 30 million consumers. All meters under this programme will be sourced from local manufacturers and in-country stock, to create jobs.
“We are committed to ending estimated billing in all forms in Nigeria, and ensuring that Nigerians pay only for the electricity they consume.”
Nigerians have been exploited by DISCOS who charge extortionately high using estimated billings.
