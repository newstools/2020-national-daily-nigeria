Gov. Godwin Obaseki spent N15bn bribe his way to picking up the PDP guber ticket days after the defecting from the ruling APC, his APC rival Osagie Ize-Iyamu has alleged.
Ize-Iyamu didn’t give evidence to support his claim.
But both candidates and their parties have been hurling claims they can’t readily substantiate at each other since the preparation for the September governorship election began.
Ize-Iyamu made his latest allegation in a statement by John Mayaki, his campaign Director of Communications, on Saturday.
“He is yet to explain to the people of Edo State where he got the 15 billion Naira he paid the PDP tax-collectors to facilitate his imposition as the party’s emergency-hour candidate.”
“It is no surprise, given the nature of Obaseki’s administration and sharp practices of both governor and appointees in Edo State.”
The APC candidate too is facing a N700m-corruption allegation in court.
