The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, has replied online news platform, Sahara Reporters, over the allegations that he is living Large in Abuja, and has also bought three mansions for his three wives after he was appointed a minister.
The online news platform, on Friday in its verified twitter handle, @SaharaReporters, said “ “PHOTONEWS:  @MBuhari ’s Minister Of Communications, @DrIsaPantami, Living Large In Abuja, Purchases Three Houses In Wuse For His Three Wives | Sahara Reporters.
The tweets also displayed the houses purportedly acquired by Dr. Pantami for his three wives.
However, in statement signed by the Minister’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman, Dr. Pantami described the allegation as outright falsehood aimed at bringing his personality into disrepute.
The statement reads in part, “For the purpose of setting the records straight, the Honourable minister has not purchased a single property anywhere in the world since being appointed a Minister. One of the apartments in the images published is one which the Honourable Minister has occupied since January 2017, more than two years before becoming a minister, while the other one is a house he rented since 17th, December 2019. Two of the images are not even known to him.
According to the statement, Dr. Pantami’s salaries and allowances fall below his earnings as a Professor at the International University, Medina, Saudi Arabia, where he still holds the record of being the first Nigerian to lecture at that level.
It said Pantami only returned to Nigeria out of the zeal to contribute his quota to national development, adding that as a successful businessman in his own right who has been comfortable in life, he has carved a niche for himself in his character.
“Dr. Patanmi’s integrity and credibility precede him, and his fight against corruption in both official and personal capacities have become a reference point not only nationally, but globally,” the statement added.
