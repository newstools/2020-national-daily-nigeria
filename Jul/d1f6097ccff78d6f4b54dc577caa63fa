On the dawn of Day 5 of the marathon investigation into the 22 allegations AGF/Justice Minister Malami Abubakar brought against EFCC suspended chairman Ibrahim Magu, a critical agency of the federal government was broken into, and computer records were taken away.
All that happened inside Aso Rock.
The Ayo-Salami-led investigative panel had on Thursday invited official of the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit, largely operating under the CBN, for questioning.
According to reports, the officers begged off because they couldn’t come armed with pieces of evidence to beef up their responses. The panel the promised to visit them Friday.
“Before they could get to the NFIU office, some unknown persons had broken into the place and destroyed the computers,” a source inside Aso Rock has been quoted s saying all over the media.
The NFIU Director-General Modibbo Hamman-Tukur eventually briefed President Muhammadu Buhari.
It was after then President Buhari decided to suspend Magu.
Malami announced the suspension July 10.
But Magu’s lawyer said his client had nothing to do with the NFIU and the incident, and such should not be roped into it.
“Magu has nothing to do with that matter. The main office of the NFIU is inside the Central Bank of Nigeria. That is where most of their operations take place,’ said Tosin Ojaomo.
“People are just doing everything possible to blackmail Magu. How can Magu who is in detention send people to destroy things? The truth will soon emerge.”
As snippets of information filter out of the panel sitting in Aso Rock, it seems Magu is going through the rough patch because of a supremacy battle between him and Malami.
