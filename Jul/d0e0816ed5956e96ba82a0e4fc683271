The presidential investigative panel probing suspended EFCC chairman Ibrahim Magu has made a demand that further spells a hard time ahead of the graft-fighter since his arrest on Monday.
As security agents ransacked Magu’s two homes in Abuja on Tuesday, and he himself was returned to detetion, the Chief of Staff to President Buhari, Ibrahim Gambari, met with the presidential probe panel on Tuesday.
While the agenda of the meeting was not disclosed, there is howevr some information about the next line of action.
Magu has been given two days to present his defence lawyers.
That might ave indicated he has cases to answer among the ‘weighty allegations’ mde against him by AGF/Justice Minister Abubakar Malami.
The minster has alleged Magu misappropriated looted funds, acted with no respect to the justice ministry supervising the EFCC.
The allegations have divided some of Magu’s support bases, including the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption headed by Prof Itse Sagay.
A member of PACAC, Prof Femi Odekunle, has defended Magu, saying Malami is merely acting out the script of a power bloc who doesn’t buy Buhari’s anti-corruption fight.
But PACAC followed that with statement distancing the committee from Odekunle’s defence of the former EFCC boss.
