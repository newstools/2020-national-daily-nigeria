The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has said there was no plan yet to reopen tertiary institutions in the country.
Dr. Sani Aliyu, the National Coordinator of PTF, stated this when he appeared on Raypower FM on Tuesday.
He pointed out that at the moment, the PTF was concerned with measures to contain community transmission of the Coronavirus.
Aliyu said the government realized that reopening of tertiary institutions, bars, restaurants and other social activities”could encourage community transmission of COVID-19.
“However, we have taken pragmatic measures to ensure we do not lose a whole year in terms of primary to secondary school transition.”
