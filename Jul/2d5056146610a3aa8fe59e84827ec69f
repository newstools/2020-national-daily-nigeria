A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, says the inconsistent stories emerging from the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) over the tragic death of Miss Tolulope Arotile, has not helped to douse suspicions.
While expressing sadness over the passing of the Nigeria’s first female combat pilot, Adegboruwa on Sunday noted that the least Nigerians expect is a proper investigation, followed with a Coroner’s Inquest, including an independent autopsy report.
Adegboruwa who described Arotile’s death as a national tragedy, stated that there is no point in rushing to bury her in the light emerging revelations.
“Who drove the car? Where did the accident happen? Where was Arotile going to? A reversing car means it had passed her, so was she trekking? Was she blindfolded not to see the reversing car to escape? Were her legs tied?
He also quipped: “What kind of medical treatment did she receive? In which hospital was she treated? Who called her out from her rest after a successful air combat on bandits? Why are there inconsistent statements from the NAF being released in bits and pieces?”
The senior lawyer urged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct a full investigation into the death and suspend the burial plans until the conclusion of the investigations.
It would be recalled that the former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode had raised suspicion over the way and manner Air Force authorities had announced her accidental death without thorough investigation.
