A prominent leader in Edo State, Chief Felix Omi Imoisili, has celebrated the leadership virtues of the late Speaker of Edo House of Assembly, Rt Hon Zakawanu Garuba, while regretting a good leader, an unbiased and unassuming leader is gone. He stated that rather than spend time mourning they should celebrate the leadership virtues of the late Speaker.
Chief Felix Omi Imoisili in a statement in Benin City on Saturday declared:  “life was taken away from us too soon and it is hard to understand why tragic things like this happen to such good people. “However, this is a question without an answer and we should not dwell on the loss of our dear friend, husband, son and brother.
“Today let’s celebrate his life and remember all of the remarkable things he accomplished and how wonderful his life was.
It is incredibly sad that his life ended so soon and I cannot put into words how much we will all miss him. He was a positive person and would not want us to be sad today. “If he were here, he would tell us to cheer up, smile and remember all of the great memories we all shared. Even though he may be gone, his memory will live on in all of us forever.
“We appreciate his friendship and he will never be forgotten. May his soul and souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace amen.”
