As parts of guidelines to contain spread of COVID-19 as the country’s reopens airports for domestic operation, the federal government said only travelers would be allowed inside airport terminals.
Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, who disclosed this during an interactive session with members of Senate Committee on Aviation in Abuja, added that those who have no business in travelling will certainly not be allowed to enter the airport terminals.
According to him, aides of politicians who have no business at the airport will not be allowed in.
He said: “All those who have no business in travelling will certainly not be allowed to enter the airport.
“So, anybody coming into the airports this time around, whether as a personality, ministers, or even honourable members and senators, will not be carrying their aides into the airports any longer.
“So, the VIPs should help us and take responsibility, and ensure that they don’t add to our problems in the country.”
The minister also allayed fears of any significant increase in airfare.
“Price is not in my hand, but like I said, with what we have put in place, I do not think that anything significant will happen to affect the propensity to fly,” he said.
