Following the detention, suspension, and sustained grilling of EFCC’s former chairman Ibrahim Magu by a presidential investigative panel housed in Aso Rock, President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed the commission’s Head of Operations Mohammed Umar as the acting chairman.
But changes might be made along the line.
Umar, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is next, in pecking order, to Magu in the commission.
There were also reports on Wednesday afternoon that the Commissioner of Police, FCT Command, Bala Ciroma, was another candidate considered for the job.
However, Umar appointment makes it the fifth time a northerner will be heading the agency since its creation in 2003 by former President Olusegun Obasanjo
The pioneer chairman was Nuhu Ribadu.
