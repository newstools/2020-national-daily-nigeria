The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) may be initiating fresh plots against the Attorney General of Federation and Minister of Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami, in the corruption war with the former EFCC acting chairman, Ibrahim Magu. Sources from the commission revealed to National Daily that the EFCC was investigating the Justice Minister on some corruption allegations at the same the AGF was also focusing his searchlight on the EFCC acting chairman. He decried that the minister struck first to unseat the acting EFCC chairman, Magu, and stimulating his investigation by Presidential Panel of Inquiry. Some EFCC officials described as Magu boys were said to have been investigating the AGF.
National Daily gathered that the EFCC has skepticism over the directive to send files of corruption cases since 2015 to the presidential panel. It was further gathered that the commission is not disposed to sending all the files to the panel. Accordingly, some files were said to be withheld by the Magu boys and may not be sent to the panel, particularly, the files on Malami’s investigation.
The Magu boys were said to be of the view that Malami may corner the EFCC files on his investigation to obstruct continuing with the probe. Sources from the commission said that Nigerians would soon hear from the EFCC about the corruption allegation status of the Minister, saying that findings from the investigation of the Justice Minister will soon be published. They maintained that the investigation files of the AGF may not be forwarded to the Presidential panel led by retired Justice Ayo Salami.
Meanwhile, Magu is still undergoing investigations by the presidential pane in Abuja, but his boys are plotting counterattack against the minister to defend and protect the commission.
