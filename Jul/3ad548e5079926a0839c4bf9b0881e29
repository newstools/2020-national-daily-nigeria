After 10 days in police custody while facing an investigative panel, the suspended EFCC boss has described his ordeal as the one of the hazards of fighting corruption.
His problem began when he was arrested by police and dragged before a sitting panel inside the Aso Rock villa to answer allegations contained in a petition against him.
He now claims the allegations are meant to tarnish his image.
“They are nonsense,” Malami to the Nation after his release July 15.
It’s okay to take his statement as that of an angry man, especially considering the personalities sweating over the farrago of ‘nonsense”: AGF/Justice Minister Abubakar Malami submitted the allegations to President Muhammadu Buhari, who decided to invite a former president of the Court of Appeal, retired Justice Ayo Salami, consider the “nonsense”.
He insisted all are trumped-up allegations against him and the EFCC, and that he never stole or diverted or converted fund for his own use.
Malami, whose ministry supervises the EFCC, has said Malami laundered N550m, bought properties in Dubai, and acted like a standalone.
“What I have gone through is a case of dog eats dog but I see it as one of those risks of the job… we must not give up in any way,” Magu said.
So far, he has not only hazarded his job, but those of the 12 directors Malami announced as suspended by Buhari on Wednesday.
He however remain as stubborn as he has been accused of.
“Whether I am EFCC Chairman or not, the anti-corruption war must continue,” he said, thanking Nigerians for their support.
The support has been pouring in form of a probe of Malami himself whom Sahara Reporters has exposed as corrupt too with a series of stories detailing multimillion-naira properties the justice minister has built for himself, his sons and wife in Kebbi, Abuja, and Kano.
