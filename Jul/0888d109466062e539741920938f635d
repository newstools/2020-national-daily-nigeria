A former Director of Strategy and Communications under the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, Jackson Ude, has insisted that his allegation that Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo collected N4bn from the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC], Ibrahim Magu, is true.
Ude was reacting to a petition Osinbajo wrote to the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, asking the IGP to initiate criminal proceedings against Jackson Ude if the allegations proved to be untrue after investigation.
In the reaction on his Twitter handle on Friday, Ude insisted that the Vice President must resign before initiating criminal proceedings against him, adding that the Presidential Panel investigating Magu and the police should be compelled to release the verbatim transcripts of Magu’s confessions.
He tweeted: “Since Osinbajo, the Star Boy, is denying, let’s have lawyers compel the Presidential Panel investigating Magu and the Police, to release the verbatim transcripts of Magu’s confessions. This is not about waving immunity.
“I am not afraid of Osinbajo and his minions. If he indeed wants to go to court, he needs to resign first, and sue me. He cannot be VP and be using state resources to intimidate the Judiciary. He cannot wave an immunity that he didn’t place. Osinabjo should resign first!
