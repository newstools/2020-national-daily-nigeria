Ibrahim Magu, the suspended EFCC boss has been released from detention after 10 days, and going by the barrages of allegations he has not been able to respond to properly, many believe he will be fighting the final battle of his career.
His antagonist is AGF Abubakar Malami who has accused him of corruption in a petition to President Muhammadu Buhari since 2015.
Apart from Magu, 12 directors of the commission and the secretary have also been suspended as advised by the Ayo Salami panel probing the allegations.
A report by Sahara Reporters claim the directors were suspended Malami for passing documents exposing AGF himself as corrupt.
Magu has also pleaded to be released on bail to prove his innocence.
Now that he’s a free man, the outgoing EFCC boss is expected to spill a lot of dirty secrets, including those of Malami’s.
