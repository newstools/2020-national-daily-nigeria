Before now, scammers needed ATM card or mobile phone to empty bank accounts, but now they have upgraded their strategy, they don’t even need your ATM card, BVN or even your mobile phone number.
A new fraud called SIM SWAP has started. Your phone network would momentarily go blind/zero (No Signal/ Zero Bars) and after a while a call will come through.
The person on the other end of the call would tell you that he is calling from (your cell phone company) depending on your network and that there is a problem in your mobile network.
He would instruct you to press 1 on your phone to get the network back.That’s it, don’t even think of pressing anything. Just cut or END the call.
If you press 1, the network would appear suddenly and almost immediately go blind again (zero bars) and by that action, your phone is hacked.
Within some minutes they would empty your bank account, and you won’t receive any alert.
It would appear as though your line is without network, meanwhile your SIM has been SWAPPED.
Swapping your SIM means exchanging your SIM card with theirs and thereby giving them full control of your account.
The danger here is that you would not get any alert of any transactions.
So please those of us doing USSD banking and mobile banking, let’s be very careful. Many accounts has been emptied and even some people reading this now might have almost fall a victim of this.
Once you start experiencing zero bars of network, it’s best to reboot your phone, doing that ends any hacking code they are doing at the moment.
Don’t answer any call telling you they are from your bank, your bank can never call you on phone and ask you to press 1 or any other number.
Also report any case of such experience to your bank to help you secure your bank account more and track the transaction.
