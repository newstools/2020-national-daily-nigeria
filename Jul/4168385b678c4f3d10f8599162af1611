The Senior Special Assistant on Media to President Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu, says President Muhammadu was being attacked because his administration decided to pursue cases of suspected wrongdoing in EFCC, pension funds, NDDC and other agencies.
Shehu in a statement pointed out that Nigerians voted for him against the background of corruption, public policy paralysis and growing menace of terrorists threatening to take over a sizable portion of the nation’s territory.
He said influencers, celebrated columnists and editorial comments, do no more than endorse the opposition’s wrong and fallacious position that the president is not in charge of his government.
He noted that detractors pick up isolated issues like the ones in the EFCC, NDDC, and incidents of crime and corruption which have been with the country for years.
He stated that the Buhari government was the first to point out the obvious embarrassment that potential acts of wrongdoing by the EFCC leadership would cause the administration.
“Did they expect the President to draw a curtain over these suspected scandals by not ordering audits and investigations? And for them to turn around to accuse him of a cover up?” he quipped.
He reminded critics that ECOWAS, Africa Union and the international community at large recognized Buhari “as Champion of the Anti-Corruption fight in Africa
The spokesman stated that in Buhari’s five years in office, there was not a single charge of corruption against his person.
Shehu noted that his principal fully understands and bears the full weight of the oaths he swore to defend the nation’s constitution, its citizens and territory, stressing that the Buhari government had done nothing to warrant condemnations.
Shehu assured President Buhari is determined not to be diverted by unfounded attacks, neither would he compromise the sacred mandate of Nigerians.
