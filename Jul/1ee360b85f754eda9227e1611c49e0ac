Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said those against the actualization of Biafra are dying off gradually, noting that the actualization of Biafra as a separate country is imminent.
Kanu disclosed this while reacting to the death of Isa Funtua, a close associate of President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday.
Funtua had died on Monday shortly after suffering cardiac arrrst.
Reacting to the development, Nnamdi Kanu on his Facebook page described Funtua as an architect of Operation Python Dance.
According to him, 2020 is Biafra year because people who swore it would never come to pass were now dying.
He wrote: “Another architect of Operation Python Dance is gone. Three down, two more to go. All those that swore they would never live to see Biafra are all slowly leaving the stage. This proves that Biafra is imminent and 2020 is our year.”
