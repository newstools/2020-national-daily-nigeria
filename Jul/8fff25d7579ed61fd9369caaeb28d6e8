Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly Correspondents’ Association (LAHACA) have condoled with the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. (Dr.) Mudashiru Ajayi Obasa, other lawmakers, staff of the assembly and family members of the late Hon. Tunde Braimoh over his sudden death on Friday July 10, 2020.

LAHACA members described the death of Hon. Braimoh who was the  Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Publicity, Security and Strategy as unexpected, sad and a great loss to the All Progressives Congress (APC), the parliament in Lagos State in particular, and Nigeria in general.

In a statement issued by the Chairman of LAHACA, Mr. Olanrewaju Adesanya, he said that the late Hon. Braimoh was an ebullient, eloquent personality and a wordsmith who spoke the English Language with dexterity.

“When Hon. Tunde Braimoh spoke, you just had to listen to him. He was blunt, effervescent, and persuasive. He was careful with his words.

“He was the Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Publicity, Security and Strategy. In that capacity, we became closer and we realized that he was good-natured.”

“In my last chat with him weeks before his sudden demise, I got a feel of how conscious he was about the wellness of his people and the residents of Lagos State in general. We spoke at length on the need for him to relate more with members of the press covering the Assembly,” the statement read.

The LAHACA Chairman then urged members of the Assembly community, his family members, his associates and friends to see his death as the will of the Almighty God, while praying that God would give his family members the fortitude to bear the loss.

Mr. Adesanya said that members of LAHACA would miss the late lawmaker and prayed that “God would give the Lagos Assembly community and the family members of the deceased the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.”
