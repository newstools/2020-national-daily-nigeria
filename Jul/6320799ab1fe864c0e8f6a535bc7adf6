The Minister of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige, at the plenary of the House of Representatives, monitored by National Daily from Lagos, on Wednesday opened an attack on the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in his altercation with a member of the House, Hon. James Abiodun Faleke. Ngige was in the House to clarify certain issues concerning his ministry which include the missing pension funds of the NSITF and the 774,000-job creation programme of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The Labour Minister was irked by the comment of Faleke, representing Ikeja federal constituency of Lagos State, extended his political spanks to Tinubu, former Lagos State Governor and APC national leader.
Dr. Ngige, addressing the lawmakers, said: “you are like my junior brothers except Faleke they say is up to 60 years.” Faleke suddenly interjected: “I am 60 plus.” Ngige then fired back: “you are near my age; but I am at least seven years older than you, I am sure. I am the same age with your mentor in Lagos, Asiwaju.
“And I was governor with him at the same time; he was a senator; I was a senator. I am a two-time minster; he is not a two-time minister;”
James Faleke interjected again: “but he won all his elections very well.”
Ngige fired back again: “no problem about that just like you won your own election in Kogi State very well and you are now the deputy governor and governor of Kogi State.” There was interruption by another member of the House who shouted: “Mr. Minister, please respond.”
Ngige further fired: “I am responding my friend; if you yab me, I yab 10 times. I am a Lagos Boy; you are just a small boy. Look at this Mushin boy talking to a V.I. boy. I lived in Victoria Island; look at this Mushin boy, from Kogi o oh. You are ogbologbo, just go, I no get time for you.”
Thereafter, the Labour Minster settled for the business of the day.
