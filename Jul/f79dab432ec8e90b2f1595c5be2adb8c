Doctors working at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Ogun, are ready to down tools amidst the on-going efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in the state.
The doctors, under the aegis the Association of Resident Doctors, have been asking for the payment of their salaries, medical and hazard allowances.
They however gave the state government weeks-long ultimatum on July 1.
According to ARD’s President Popoola Abiodun, and Osundara Tope, general-secretary, in statement on Wednesday, the doctors decided to withdraw their services from the COVID-19 treatment centre due to the lack of commitment by the state government.
“Our members are no longer at ease with the disposition of the government. Our matters are not hard rocks difficult for Ogun State Government to deliquesce.
“Since the government has chosen to simply rub the issues without any form of real commitment, our members working at the COVID-19 Isolation Centre will henceforth join the industrial action.
“We expect the government not to dethrone reasoning or shirk from responsibility expected of a considerate, sincere and truthful government.
“We call on Ogun State Government not to leave us up a creek without a paddle. Our service to the people should not be abridged by the ineptitude of the government. We work for the common good and sound health of the people of Ogun State.”
Gov. Dapo Abiodun took strongly to the July warning threat, describing the doctors as inhuman.
