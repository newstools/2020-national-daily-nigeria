The federal government has finally approved the first and only local remedy for treating covid-19 symptoms after eight weeks the health ministry called on herbal medicine practitioners to submit their candidate potion.
Nigeria has joined the rest of the world in the race to find a cure for Covid-19 infection that became a pandemic Feb 2020, and has infected close to 30,000 people in Nigeria.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control recently approved Paxherbal Cugzin by Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories based in Edo.
The director of the lab, Rev. Fr. Anslem Adodo, announced this in an internal memo that went viral on social media.
“After a series of screening, spanning eight weeks, NAFDAC has today approved our Paxherbal COVID-19 herbal drug, Paxherbal Cugzin, for public use,” Adodo said in the memo.
“It is the first to be so approved and presently the only one. The drug is specifically for treating the symptoms associated with the coronavirus.”
According to him, NAFDAC gave an initial cautious approval for the drug under the brand CVD PLUS until the final approval under the brand name Paxherbal Cugzin with a number: A7-4358L.
The drug is in capsules and packaged in a container of eighty 290mg capsules. It ingredients include Garcinia Kola, Curcuma Longa and Zingiber officinale.
NAFDAC boss Adeyeye told the House of Reps recently that no fewer than 20 potential local cure were forwarded to the agency for approval. These don’t include the Malagasy organic tonic shipped in month ago.
Now it is apparent Paxherbal Cugzin is the only successful candidate, and it’s not a cure yet, but a drug for treating symptoms of Covid-19.
