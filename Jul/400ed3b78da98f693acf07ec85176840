The President of Answers in Genesis, Ken Ham who believes that everything in the Bible should be taken literally has announced that his organization would construct the 510-foot-long ship in Kentucky.
Ham built a £77million replica of Noah’s ark to prove that the story actually happened.

He went further to explain that since scientists have been arguing that it would be detrimental to children’s education – taking particular umbrage with the fact that it was granted state tax incentives.
He added that it was opened to great fanfare on Tuesday – with a high school marching band performing before a ribbon cutting.
‘I believe this is going to be one of the greatest Christian outreaches of this era in history,’ Ham said.

The attraction, called #ArkEncounter, is based on the #OldTestament tale about Noah, a man who got a warning from #God that a flood would destroy the world.
Ham says the ark will now stand as proof that stories in the Bible are true.
