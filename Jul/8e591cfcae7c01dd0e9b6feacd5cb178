The story of a baby girl that was rescued by the Military Joint Task Force (JTF) Soldiers fighting terrorists in the northeast has moved a lot of Nigerians.

The baby was seen crawling inside a cave in a forest when the soldiers fighting Boko Haram in the northeast got there.Â  They found out that the mother died few days ago, as her hand and legs were seen rotting away.

The rescued girl is doing just fine now.

Some of the soldiers said that the girl is a hero, for being alive days after the mother had died.

Wild animals or even hunger would have killed her in the cave, but she survived the situation.


People have since blessed and praised God for preserving the girls life.
