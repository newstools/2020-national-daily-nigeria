The Department of Security Service (DSS) on Monday arrested the Acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. Details of the arrest were sketchy at the time of this report but it may not be unconnected with the memo by the Attorney General of Federation and Minister of Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami, alleging corrupt practices against the EFCC chairman.
The Department of Security Service (DSS) arrested the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations that he owns four luxury property as well as alleged transfer of funds overseas through a third party.
Magu was arrested at the Wuse II office of the DSS on Monday afternoon and was made to undergo interrogation at the DSS Headquarters at Aso Drive.
It was gathered that the DSS had in a 2016 report indicated that Magu was living in a N40 million mansion.
