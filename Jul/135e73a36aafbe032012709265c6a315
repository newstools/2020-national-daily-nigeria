Five aid workers were blindfolded and shot dead by gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram sect in a video going viral online.
The terrorists said their victims were aid workers with nongovernmental organisations working in the northeast.
In the video five masked, armed men stood behind the five abductees kneeling down as a voice spoke in Hausa.
“This is a message to the infidels who are using you to cheat and turn our people into unbelievers. You should know that your employers are just using you to achieve their aims, but they don’t care about you. That’s why whenever we abduct you, they don’t care about you.
“Our advice for you is that you should repent and turn to God, or else we shall continue to waylay and abduct you all in all the routes that you traverse.
“And if you don’t heed to our warning, what is about to happen to these five aid workers would also be fate that will befall you too.”
After the speech, one of the gunmen ordered them to fire at the aid workers.
Boko Haram has concentrated on abducting and killing aid workers on humanitarian service in the northeast.
The UN and President Muhammadu Buhari separately condemned the last killing before this.
