Ondo’s Dep. Gov. Agboola Ajayi might just have begun his way out office as the state legislature moves to impeach him on Monday.
Ajayi and hs bos Rotimi Akeredolu have been at war for months, leading to the defection of Ajayi to the PDP where he’s seeking the party guber ticket to contest against Akeredolu in the forth-coming election..
The state lawmakers have been called back from recess to deliberate on the matter.
The Clerk of the Assembly, Mr. Bode Adeyelu had in a short message sent to the legislators directed them to ensure compliance with the directive given by the Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun.
“This is to inform all Honourable Members of the Ondo State House of Assembly that following the expiration of your RECESS on Friday, 3rd July, 2020, l have been directed by the Rt. Honourable Speaker Oleyelogun Bamidele David to enjoin you to resume for Legislative duties on Monday, 6th July, 2020,” the message read.
Ajayi is already alleging N10m has been doled out to each of the lawmaker to make sure the impeachment motion meets the requirement of two-third majority, about 18 out of the 26 lawmakers in the state.
The impeachment move is coming after Ajayi demanded Akeredolu, who is down with covid-19 hand power over to him in 21 days.
But Akeredolu has declared he would not hand over to a traitor who is no longer part of the government.
