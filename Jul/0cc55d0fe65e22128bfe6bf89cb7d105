The Benue state government house may be in a serious pandemic crisis as majority of Governor Samuel Ortom’s inner circle have tested positive to the deadly COVID-19, while the governor himself is still negative.
It was gathered that the Secretary to the State Government, Chief of Staff and Head of Service have all tested positive to the deadly virus.
Ortom, whose wife also tested positive, announced Saturday that the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Tony Ijohor and Chief of Staff, Mr Terwase Orbunde have tested positive to COVID-19.
He further said that the State Head of Service, Mrs Veronica Onyeke also tested positive to the virus, alongside the Deputy Vice Chancellor Administration, Benue State University, Makurdi, Prof. Godwin Achinge.
“It is no longer news that my wife, one of my sons and staff tested positive to the virus too. The test was carried out about a week ago. When the result came out 35 persons in the state tested positive to the virus.
“My test result came out negative. But the medical officers said that another test will be carried out on me after three days. So, after this interaction I will isolate myself. I will be in isolation until I have clearance from the medical officers.
“COVID-19 is real and I enjoin my people to take the preventive measures seriously. I want my people to be alive and free from the disease. “We have to stop the spread of the disease by maintaining all the COVID-19 protocols,” he said.
The governor also urged Benue people to avail themselves for testing, stressing that the earlier the disease is detected the better.
