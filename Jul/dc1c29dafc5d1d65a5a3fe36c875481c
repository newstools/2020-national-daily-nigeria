The revelations from the investigations of the N81.5 billion corruption allegations in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) against the Interim Management Committee (IMC) by the National Assembly and other agencies portray that the forensic audit of the commission which President Muhammadu Buhari mandated the IMC may have been replaced by forensic looting of NDDC. Preponderant expenditures of the IMC during the period of the coronavirus lockdown in Nigeria were on leisure and non-development projects. Most of the claims are also difficult to substantiate given the coronavirus lockdown.
Highlight of the NDDC N81.5 billion-part expenditures was presented as follows:
Covid-19                                                                        NN31.4 billion
Overseas travels for graduation of NDDC foreign scholarship beneficiaries   N85.6 million
Maintenance                                                                   N220 million
Legal services                                                                 N900 million
Lassa fever                                                                     N1.956 billion
Community relations                                                      N1.3 billion
Impress                                                                          N790.9 million
Condolences                                                                   N122.9 million
Consultancy                                                                   N83 million
DAT                                                                               N486 million
These were p[art of the activities that thew NDDC Interim Management Committee claimed that have taken place during the lockdown. However, they may need to account for the number of deaths that costs N122.9 million condolence visits, number of court cases handled during the period of the expenditure, how many schools were operating overseas at a time governments were enforcing lockdown, among others.
However, details of capital projects expenditures are being awaited, perhaps, as the Minster of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, appears before the House of Representatives Committee investigating the corruption allegations.
