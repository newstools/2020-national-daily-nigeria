The National Coordinator of Concerned Advocates for Good Governance [CAGG], Olusegun Bamgbose, says there is no better time than now for politicians eyeing the 2023 presidential election to show interest, noting that they needed to showcase their stuff to Nigerians on time.
Bamgbose stated this in a statement on Sunday while reacting to a statement credited to the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan that it was premature to start talking about 2023 presidency.
Lawan, in his statement, had also said he was not interested in contesting for the presidency and Bamgbose said this, “is no doubt a defeatist statement.”
The Lagos-based lawyer, who had earlier declared his interest to run in the 2023 presidential election noted that it was never premature for anyone to start indicating his interest ahead of 2023 the election.
“He is qualified constitutionally to contest. It’s wrong of him to state that, it’s premature for anyone to start talking about 2023,” he said.
“Proper preparation, they say, prevents poor performance. It’s never too early to start indicating early interest in contesting ahead of 2023.
“It takes time for one to be President of Nigeria. We don’t want emergency President any longer. I will expect politicians to start making open declarations.
2023: No better time than now for politicians to show interest
“They need to start showcasing their stuff to Nigerians on time. There is no better time than now for politicians to show interest.
 
“They will need to speak out on national issues and proffer solutions to myriad of challenges confronting us as a nation.
“Lawan should not be scared about what Nigerians will say if he by his body language shows that he is interested in taking over from Buhari.
“It’s obvious from his reaction that he is highly interested in running come 2023. Ambition is never a crime. Aspiration is never forbidden. He is welcome on board.”
