Rev Chris Okotie of the Household of God church has condemned US billionaire, Bill Gates over his role in the Covid 19 pandemic.
In an 80 – minute video released early today on YouTube, the pastor sensationally accused Mr. Gates of leading a global conspiracy to destabilize the world economy and execute a satanic agenda against the church.
According to him, the Covid-19 pandemic is a bizarre project conceived by Gates, in association with some powerful elements in the multilateral institutions, supported by key leaders of governments around the world, to achieve sinister objectives.
Of these objectives, he said, are: a systematic reduction of the world population through the increasing Covid -19 deaths; enforcement of a global lockdown to ruin the economies of nations and impoverish the people and frustrate true worship of the Living God.
He quoted diverse scriptures and, in his usual biblical exposition of complex doctrines, explained from the Gates family tree, how the billionaire figures in Satan’s end time assault on the church.
The apocalyptic teachers used numerology to explain the names of three generations of the Gates family vis-à-vis their scriptural equivalents and their roles in the dispensational dealings of God with man.
He explained how the roles of various key Bible characters like the Lord Jesus Christ, Adam, Eve, Solomon, David, Daniel and an event like Sodom and Gomorrah  down to the operations of Satanic forces in this age, including the rise of the LGBT.
To him, the vaccine being developed to check the spread of Covid-19 is a red herring meant to disguise the real sinister intentions of the purported antidotes for the pandemic, which he said, could ultimately cause death on a mass scale.
He criticized syncretism and ministers who are pursing the concept of one world religion, saying it was part of Satan’s overall plan to rubbish the uniqueness of the Christian faith, and sabotage the redemptive plan of God.
