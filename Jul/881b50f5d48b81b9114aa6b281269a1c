The Edo State High Court in Benin City has dismissed the the fraud charges brought against the former Chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Edo state branch, Dr Emmanuel Ighodaro, and two other executive members of the body by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commissioned (EFCC).

Justice Efe Ikponwonba on Tuesday acquits all the defendants after listening to all the arguments and counter arguments by both the prosecution counsels and defendants counsels.

It could be recalled that EFCC had arraigned in January 2018, Dr. Ighodaro and four others namely Dr. Anthony Owolabi, Dr. Quincy Atoghengbe, Dr. Raymond Ogieva, and Dr. Oseremen Gabriel Ogbebor, for allegedly conspiring  to commit felony, punishable under Section 516 of the Criminal Code CAP 48 Laws of Bendel State of Nigeria as applicable to Edo State.

However, at the hearing of the case which commenced 9am till 10:30am at Court one, Aiguobasimi, GRA, Benin City, Counsels to Defendants, Imadugbelo Ighodalo (SAN) and K. O. Obamogie prayed the court to dismiss the charges and acquit the defendants, Counsel to EFCC, S.I. Ibekute vehemently opposed these applications.

Recall that the court had earlier  in May 2018 acquited and discharged Dr Quincy Atohengbe and Dr Raymond Ogieva of the charges.
 

With this development, the fraud charges levelled against the ex-NMA officials have finally come to an end.
