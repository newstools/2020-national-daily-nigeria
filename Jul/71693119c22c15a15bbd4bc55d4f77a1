The director, Obaseki/Shaibu Movement and member of the state Waste Management Board has resigned his appointment.
Patrick Iyoha in a letter dated July 28, addressed to Gov. Godwin Obaseki, said that his resignation was with immediate effect and due to personal reason.
Two other members, Gabriel Oiboh, Chairman, State Post Primary Education Board,  Osanyemwere Osawe, also rendered their letters of resignation to the governor.
Oiboh and first member of the board, Osawe, in a letter dated July 28, said that their resignations followed pressure to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress, APC.
Three commissioners of the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Area Development Commission had resigned their appointments earlier on Monday.
The commisioners — Osamwonyi Atu, Emmanuel Odigie and Rilwanu Oshiomhole — represented Edo South, Edo Central and Edo North senatorial districts.
The forthcoming guber election is a straight fight between Obaseki and the APC candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu backed by the party’s national chairman and Obaseki’s ex-godfather Adams Oshiomhole.
Oshiomhole has been on all fours praying and begging the Edo electorate to forgive him for giving them Obaseki in 2016.
