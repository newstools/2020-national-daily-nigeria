As spate of killing rises and the Kaduna government appears undecided in taking action, women in Southern Kaduna, the hotspot of this ethno-religious killing, began a protest Thursday.
And the protest was one of its kind—without a stitch on.
The women began the rally from their traditional leader’s home where they got some sort of anointing (literally) before they moved out bare-backed.
Southern Kaduna is largely populated by Christians, and no fewer than 300 of them have been killed since July 1, according to the  International Society for Civil Liberties & Rule of Law.
