Chelsea take on Watford at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening knowing that three points may be required to retain their spot in the top four of the Premier League standings.
Meanwhile, Watford make the trip to West London knowing that victory could put the club as many as four points above the relegation zone with just five games remaining.
Prediction: Chelsea to win or draw. Both Team To School.
With Watford having had a week to prepare for this contest, we are expecting a closely-fought match at Stamford Bridge. However, under pressure to improve after their setback in midweek, Chelsea could edge this game if Lampard freshens up his team.
