US presidential wannabe and rapper Kanye West has put his oar into the covid-19 vaccine debate, alleging a grand plot by the gate of hell.
In an interview with Forbes, the singer narrated his infection with Covid-19 recently, and how he felt going through it.
“I remember someone had told me Drake had the coronavirus and my response was Drake can’t be sicker than me!” he said.
His opinion of the race for a vaccine for the infection—and of vaccines generally—has a flavor of the last-day event.
He said he suspected a conspiracy with COVID-19 vaccine.
“So many of our children are being vaccinated and paralyzed, so when they say the way we’re going to fix Coronavirus is with a vaccine, I’m extremely cautious,” the independent candidate for the 2020 presidential election  told the magazine.
“That’s the mark of the beast. They want to put chips inside of us and do all kinds of things, to make it where we can’t cross the gates of heaven.
Those referered to as “they” he said are the “humans that have the Devil inside them”.
There have been various theories spun around the vaccine and those promoting its research, including biliionaire Bill Gates.
