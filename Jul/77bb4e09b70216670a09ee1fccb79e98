National Chairman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party [PDP], Uche Secondus, has demanded for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari over alleged cases of corruption in federal agencies.
He made the call at an ongoing media briefing in Abuja on Friday.
He cited ongoing corruption investigations of the NDDC, MIC, NEDC, NSITF, EFCC and others, stating Nigeria, under Buhari’s watch, was on ventilator gasping for breath.
Secondus, who said corruption has become a way of life among Nigerians while Buhari plays the ostrich, accused Buhari of abandoning his promise to fight corruption during electioneering campaigns in 2015 and 2019.
Recall that the Niger Delta Development Corporation has been in the news lately following an alleged misappropriation of N40bn by the Interim Management Committee.
