Contrary to initial news that EFCC’s acting chairman IIbrahim Magu was schlepped into detention by the DSS, the commission said he’s only facing an investigative panel which he honored voluntarily.
The EFCC said this in a statement by its Spokesman, Dele Oyewale, on Monday.
“Mr. Ibrahim Magu on Monday,  July 6,  2020, honoured an invitation by a Presidential Panel reviewing the activities of the EFCC, at the Banquet Hall wing of the Presidential Villa,  Abuja,” the commission stated.
“He was served the invitation to the panel while on his way to the Force Headquarters, Abuja for a meeting.   The EFCC’s boss was neither arrested nor forced to honour the invitation.  A member of a legal team from the EFCC is also with him on the panel.”
AGF/Justice Minister Abubakar Malami accused Magu recently of corruption and misappropriation of recovered loot.
Nigerians however remember the cat-and-mouse relationship between the two dates back to 2016, when the DSS under Daura Lawan, Malami, and the late Abba Kyari CoS to President Muhammadu Buhari colluded to frustrate confirmation of Magu by the Senate.
On more than two occasions, the DSS petitioned the Senate, led by ex-Sen. President Bukola Saraki, against Magu. And the federal lawmakers refused to screen him.
Saraki, then, was among the alleged looters Magu was prosecuting.
While he apparently enjoyed the backing of V.P Osinbajo and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Anti-Corruption Prof Itse Sagay,  Kyari then, holding sway at Aso Rock, was named among the cabal frustrating Magu’s confirmation.
Although Kyari is dead now, the frosty relationship between the Kyari camp, in which Malami now looms large, is still active.
