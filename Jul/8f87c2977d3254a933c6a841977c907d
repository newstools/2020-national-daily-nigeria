Share this on WhatsAppThe Council of Traditional Rulers in Edo State at the weakened declined to endorse the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC),  Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, for the September 19 governorship election in the state despite kneeling down to beg the royal fathers during a campaign engagement.
The former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, also failed to gain the favour or acceptance of the traditional rulers even after he knelt to apologise to them of his support for the incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki in 2016. The former APC chairman appears to be incurring the anger of the Edo people with his apologies for the emergence of Obaseki as governor.

Both Ize-Iyamu and Oshiomhole had met with the Enigies to present the APC candidate’s manifesto, Simple Agenda.  However, His Royal Highness, Edomwonyi Iduozee Ogiegbean, on behalf of the Enigies insisted that traditional rulers are non-partisan and cannot declare support for any candidate in the election.

They, however, offered prayers to him for his governorship ambition. He maintained that traditional rulers do not take sides with political parties or candidates, noting that they are custodian of all stakeholders in the state.
Invariably, the political overtures of Oshiomhole, Ize-Iyamu and the APC, to the Edo traditional rulers failed to accomplish the mission.

On the other divide, the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, hosting Governor Obaseki and the PDP campaign team, also maintained neutral position but recalled that his prayers saved Governor Godwin Obaseki for the four years in office. He appealed for more prayers in the state for a peaceful election.
