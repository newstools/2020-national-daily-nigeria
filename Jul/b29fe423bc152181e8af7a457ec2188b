After several weeks of suspension from flying for violating the COVID-19 lockdown rule, the Federal Government on Monday announced it has lifted the indefinite suspension placed on ExecuJet.
Recall that the Ministry of Aviation had suspended ExecuJet airline indefinitely for false information and for flying Azeez Fashola, popularly known as Naira Marley to Abuja for a concert on June 12.
ExecuJet’s aircraft had conveyed Marley to perform at a concert in Abuja despite a ban on interstate travel and for violating social distancing rules aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Announcing the lift of the suspension on Monday, Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said the ministry decided to lift the ban following the compliance of the service with sanctions imposed on it.
He said: “Today, we lifted the ban on Executive Jets Air Services Limited. They have complied substantially with all of our imposed sanctions.
“They have paid parts of the fine and they have brought out a payment plan for the balance. So, we lifted the ban and they will continue to do their business. These are not punitive, they are things to make our industry work better and keep all of you safe.”
The minister also revealed that he was yet to get the report on the investigation conducted by the aviation industry following a violation of the COVID-19 protocols by dignitaries.
He said: “As to the VIP offenders which are undergoing investigation, the report will be on my desk this week hopefully and we will keep you posted.”
