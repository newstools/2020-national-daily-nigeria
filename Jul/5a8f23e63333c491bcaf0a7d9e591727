While the House of Reps is spitting fire and brimstones because Niger Delta Minister Godswill Akpabio let it slip—that the NASS members are bigger beneficiaries of the NDDC contracts—the upper chamber has turned a blind eye.
Akpabio, a former senator, was fingered in some of the financial misappropriations the House probed, but the Senate hasn’t looked into that.
The Senate ad hoc committee set up to probe the allegations of corruption in the commission only focused on the commission’s Interim Management Committee.
It recommended that the NDDC should be returned to the Presidency for direct supervision, and the monitoring and advisory bodies recognised by the NDDC Act should be inaugurated immediately.
On the forencic audit President Muhammadu Buhari ordered, the Senate committee noted that the Ministry of Niger Delta has no capacity to implement that.
It urged the auditor-general of the federation should supervise the forensic audit for transparency and efficiency.
