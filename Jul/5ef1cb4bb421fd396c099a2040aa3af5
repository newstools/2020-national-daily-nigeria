The Department of State Services (DSS) has refuted reports that the Service arrested the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. “We did not arrest Ibrahim Magu, acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC),” DSS declared.
DSS in a statement by the Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, explained that the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, on Monday, honoured an invitation by a Presidential Panel reviewing the activities of the EFCC at the Banquet Hall wing of the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
The DSS said that Magu was served the invitation to the Panel, while on his way to the Force Headquarters, Abuja for a meeting.
“The EFCC’s boss was neither arrested nor forced to honour the invitation.  A member of a legal team from the EFCC is also with him on the Panel,” the DSS said.
The Service’s Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, also said that the DSS has since been inundated with inquiries over the reported arrest of Magu, stressing that the Service has no connection with the incident.
Afunanya issued the statement after reports emerged that the acting chairman of the anti-graft agency had been arrested by DSS officials in Abuja.
Magu’s Media S.A., Tony Amokeodo, was said have further explained that his boss was not arrested but only invited to answer questions regarding some allegations against the agency.
Amokeodo explained that Magu was invited to appear before a Federal Government panel set up to investigate the allegations of corruption levelled against him.
It was reiterated that the panel is sitting at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. v
