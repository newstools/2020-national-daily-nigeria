Following the PTF on Covid-19 decision to implement what it calls precision lockdown across 18 LGAs in Nigeria, Osun Governor Gboyega Oyetola has ordered a total lockdown in four local government areas in the state for one week.
So from Tuesday, July 7, Ilesa East, Ilesa West, Atakumosa East, and Atakumosa West are going to be sealed for seven days.
If the compliance level is not encouraging, the government will announce a further extension.
Other LGAs with rising cases of infection may also be shut down.
However, the relaxation in other areas of the state has been extended by two weeks.
In a statement issued by the State’s Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, the government said the decision to impose a total lockdown on the four local government areas was aimed at containing the spread of the virus in that axis of the state.
It said the government has every reason to believe that the state is already witnessing what looks more like a community transmission.
On the current lockdown, residents in that axis will not have the opportunity to go to worship centres and markets during the period. They will only be allowed to shop within their neighbourhoods.
There would be no vehicular movement, inter-or intra-state, within the affected areas either—except those on essential services.
“For the avoidance of doubt, our curfew will still run from 9.p.m to 5.a.m daily in other parts of the State, except the locked down LGAs.
