Days after the federal government announced re-opening of school for primry six, JSS 3, and SS3 schoolchildren, the Lagos government has turned around to keep all the learning institutions—except SS3—shuttered in the state.
Now, only students in Senior Secondary 3 classes will resume in Lagos—and Ogun.
Special Adviser, Education, Lagos, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, said this on Tuesday.
Also the Special Adviser to the Ogun State Governor on Education, Mrs. Ronke Soyombo, also confirmed resumption for only SS3 pupils.
Their counterpart in Ekiti, Education Commissioner, Mr. Foluso Daramola, said a decision would be taken on JSS3 classes after a meeting with Governor Kayode Fayemi.
But all Federal Government Colleges (aka Unity Schools) will resume August 4 for SS3 pupils only.
