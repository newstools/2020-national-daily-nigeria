A band of armed criminals made a huge kill among the federal troops waging war against armed banditry in the Operation Sahel Sanity campaign around Katsina on the weekend.
The criminals ambushed a company of soldiers of the Nigerian military Special Forces advancing on foot at Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina.
“Nigerian troops of Special Army Super Camp (SASC) 4 were ambushed by armed Bandits while on advance to notorious bandit leader’s camp Known as Dangote at Shimfida in Jibia Local Government Area,” a report was quoted as saying by PRNigeria.
“Troops were advancing on foot when bandits began engaging them from the hill.”
Among the dead were officers and soldiers.
The injured have been evacuated.
The online news platform said there were pictures of the incident, but were too graphic to be published.
