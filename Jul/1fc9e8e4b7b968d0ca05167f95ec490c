Senator Nicholas Tofowomo, representing Ondo South Senatorial District, has sacked a total of 92 aides working for him on Friday.
In a statement by his media aide, Olumide Akinrinola, the disengagement of the non-statutory political aides takes effect from July 24, 2020.
The senator stated that a reconstitution of new aides would be communicated later at the appropriate time.
It would be recalled that the 92 aides were appointed last year shortly after he won the senatorial election in 2019.
The senator disclosed then that he appointed the large numbers of aides as part of his empowerment drive aimed at reducing joblessness, youth restiveness, thuggery and other social vices.
