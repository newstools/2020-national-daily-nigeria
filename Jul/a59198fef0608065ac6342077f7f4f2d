Former governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose, says the ongoing investigation would not be completed without digging into who bought the many properties seized by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission [EFCC] and how they were sold.
Fayose stated this while reacting to the ongoing probe of Ibrahim Magu, suspended former acting Chairman of the anti-graft agency corruption charges by a Special Presidential Panel.
In a statement by his Media Aide, Lere Olayinka, Fayose said the probe must not be just to achieve the sole aim of removing Magu from office, adding that “Nigerians are interested in the identities of buyers of the properties seized by EFCC and how they
He said; “Nigerians must know the beneficiaries of the seized properties and how they were sold because most of these properties were bought by associates of Magu, including some so-called human rights lawyers.
“These human rights lawyers were his promoters and today, they are the ones defending him because they know that if this investigation goes deeper than just looking for what Magu did wrong so as to remove him from office, their own dirty secrets will be revealed for Nigerians to see.
“It should not end up as a tool just to remove Magu because removing him will not be enough, the loots already ‘re-looted’ must be ‘re-recovered’ and those who ‘re-looted’ the loots brought to book.
“Also, those holding money and properties in trust for Magu as well as those who must have helped him to launder money must be revealed”
