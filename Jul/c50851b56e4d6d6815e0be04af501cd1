Bill Gates may have become scared of losing his huge investment in vaccine manufacture, thus, insisting on administering the COVID-19 vaccines on healthy citizens. Gate and the World Health Organization (WHO) had insisted that they have confidence in two frontline COVID vaccines: the AstraZeneca (Oxford) vaccine and Moderna’s. National Daily gathered that Bill Gates had invested in both vaccines.
There are fears that Gates and WHO’s endorsement of the two lemons should worry anyone hoping that Operation Warp Speed, its billionaire patron and global regulators, are capable of yielding a safe or effective shot.
Gates, Fauci, and WHO have since February been assuring of a major breakthrough in vaccine discovery that will ensure immunity in seven million people, prevent transmission, and impose minimal side effects. However, there have been observations of poor performances of the vaccines they are imposing on countries of the world.  Scholars have expressed reservations that the vaccine may not prevent transmission. But Fauci is giving assurance of 70% immunity.
It was noted that animal trials have proved the Oxford vaccine ineffective against COVID-19. Yet, Astra-Zeneca proceeded to launch human trials. Some have warned that while vaccine developers have never dared to conduct testing against a true inert placebo as such tests would likely reveal safety problems, lead Oxford developer Andrew Pollard will now give trial participants a notoriously reactogenic meningitis vaccine, as a “control”– a common ploy to mask injuries from experimental vaccines. The trials were said to have 50 side effects from meningitis vaccines.
