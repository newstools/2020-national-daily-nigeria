While the PTF on Covid-19 lifted inter-state travel ban and the restriction on the education sector, the Ogun government has insisted some of the restrictions remain, and it is also contemplating shutting down the state’s border again
For instance, worship centers and schools would remain closed for another two weeks in the state.
In a statement made available to newsmen on Friday night by his Chief Press Secretary, Ogun Gov Dapo Abiodun said available data and opinions of experts continue to indicate that the fight against the virus is far from being won.
According to him, an Ogun border Local Government is one of those with the highest number of cases in the country because of the level of testing.
“This high level of prevalence may also be obtainable in other local governments as we ramp up testing,” the statement read in part.
“All this emphasises the need for us to exercise a high level of restraint as the State can neither afford more fatalities nor allow the rate of sickness to outnumber the capacity to manage the sick.”
On the federal government’s decision to lift the ban on interstate travels, the governor said the state will monitor this development to determine its impact on the COVID-19 “…[We] will not hesitate to make appropriate adjustments, in consultation with the federal government.”
The government insisted that the following restrictions will remain in place:
“All 5 working days in the week (Monday to Friday) are still open for businesses and other economic transactions with only Saturday and Sunday as lockdown days;
“Commercial activities are not permitted on weekends;
“Churches and mosques activities will remain closed.”
