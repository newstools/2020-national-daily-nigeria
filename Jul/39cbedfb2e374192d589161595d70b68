The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the September 19, 2020, election in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, may have created fresh political liability for the APC as the party gears up for the governorship election. The APC candidate is still carrying a burden of trust worthiness as he has continued to face prosecution over allegations of N700 million fraud. The APC governorship candidate in Edo State, Ize-Iyamu is being prosecuted with four other persons on 8 count charges on allegations of money laundering in the sum of N700 million.
It was gathered that the case was to be held on Thursday, but the court did not sit because of the absence of the presiding Judge of a Federal High Court in Benin City where the suit was filed. The court, therefore, adjourned the N700 million alleged fraud suit against the APC candidate.  The suit was adjourned to July 7, 2020 for hearing.
Meanwhile, the APC has constituted its campaign committee headed by Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State. The campaign committee also consisted of the dismissed APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, former APC national chairman and supporter of Governor Godwin Obaseki, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, and others.
