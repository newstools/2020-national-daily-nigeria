On Saturday, she boarded a Toyota Sienna commercial vehicle to Akwa Ibom State but never made it home.
Unfortunately, the vehicle she boarded was said to have driven against traffic shortly after a heavy rain around 4pm.
Sadly, a lorry, which had the right of way, was said to have rammed into their vehicle.
It was further gathered from the PUNCH that there were two Toyota Sienna minivans headed towards Akwa Ibom. Around Daewoo just long Onne Road, a trailer had broken down on their lane so they decided to drive against traffic.”
“One of the Sienna minivans was the vehicle in which the doctor was in. A lorry which had the right of way did not see them on time, lost control and rammed into them. Good Samaritans took them to a hospital. Three of them were taken to Sonabel Hospital around the trailer park while Dr Iroegbu was transferred to Morning Star Hospital, Onne, but painfully, she died at midnight.”
