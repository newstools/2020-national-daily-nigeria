The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), has said that Governor Yahaya Bello and the All Progressives Congress can run, but cannot outrun the Supreme Court over alleged fraud perpetuated during the November 2019 governorship election in Kogi.
Kogi State Publicity Secretary of the party, Bode Ogunmola, stated this in a statement on Saturday while reacting to an Appeal Court judgement on the Kogi governorship election delivered on Saturday.
Ogunmola described the judgement as a travesty of justice and vowed to head for the Supreme Court.
“Gov. Yahaya Bello and the APC can run, but it cannot hide from the Supreme Court, where the blood of the innocent people killed in the Kogi election and the irregularities that characterized the election would be pointed out.”
Ogunmola urged PDP supporters to remain calm and be hopeful.
The PDP said the party would never give up until justice was delivered and Engr Musa Wada becomes the Governor of Kogi State, particularly that he was overwhelmingly voted for in the November governorship election.
