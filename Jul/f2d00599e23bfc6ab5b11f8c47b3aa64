The man who started the chain of events that led to the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Stephen Oshawo, has finally opened up on why his Ward 10 in Etsako West Local Government area of Edo state suspended Oshiomhole.
Oshawo, who is the Ward 10 Chairman of the APC, Oshiomhole’s ward, gave the suspension order that eventually led to the removal of Oshiomhole as the party’s chairman by the Court.
Speaking at event in Benin recently, Oshawo disclosed that among other things responsible for the suspension, Oshiomhole’s inability to pay his pension for eight months stood out.
He said: “You know, this government believes in development and the masses. The truth is that, when the former government (Oshiomhole) was in power as the governor of the state, I was an insider, I was the chairman of Ward 10. I suffered many things and nobody knew me or recognized me.
“As a chairman to the governor of the state, I couldn’t receive my gratuity as a pensioner and as a chairman to Oshiomhole when he was still the governor of the state, I was not able to get my pension for eight months, but when Godwin Obaseki came in, it didn’t take him up to a month, he paid my gratuity and not only me but all the pensioners in Edo State.”
He however denied that the suspension was influenced by Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state who had since decamped to the Peoples’ Democratic Party.
