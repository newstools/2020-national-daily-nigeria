The traders said” we sell fruits, others, it’s not good to displace people without giving them alternative places because most people earn a living from it and those people who only feed from hawking and now that they have been stopped, it will bring increase in crime rate in the state, it is affecting our daily sales as we cannot openly display our fruits for people to see and buy”


In a swift reaction, Mrs Joan Mrakpor, Director General, DSCTDA, said that the traders were displaced for violating the state law on environment and cleaniness, stressing that the state government would not provide any alternative for them rather they should move into the market for their businesses
