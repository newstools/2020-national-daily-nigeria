The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, may be running  into fresh trouble as he incurs the wrath of members of the House of Representatives over his allegation that members of the National Assembly were awarded contacts by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon.  Femi Gbajabiamila, therefore, issued the minster 48 hours to publish the names of lawmakers who were awarded contracts by the NDDC as well as the details of the contracts.
“Should the minister fail to publish the names, the House will employ the full wrath of the law to ensure he does so.,” Gbajabiamila declared.
The Speaker issued the ultimatum at the plenary on Tuesday, after the minister on his appearance at the House Committee on NDDC investigation of N40 billion impropriety allegations.
Akpabio testifying before the House Committee on NDDC on Monday, stated that members of the National Assembly were “the greatest beneficiaries” of NDDC contracts. “I just told you that we have records to show that most of the contracts in the NDDC are given out to members of the National Assembly,” he insisted.

Gbajabiamila said Akpabio was pulling the oldest trick in the book with the claims, adding that the minister owes it to the country to publish the names in the interest of transparency.
A member of the investigative committee however disagreed with Akpabio that contracts were awarded to all lawmakers in the NDDC.
