The acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, was delayed at the Presidential Villa, Abuja after he arrived the State House, Abuja, on the invitation of a presidential panel investigating allegations of corruption against him on Monday. Sources in Presidency disclosed that Magu was still at the Presidential Villa under the Department of Security Service (DSS) even after members of the probe panel have all gone home. Magu’s phones were seized and he was yet to leave the Aso Rock as at midnight.
The EFCC boss has not been reachable since he entered the Presidential Villa Monday afternoon. His friends and family members are becoming increasingly apprehensive over the EFCC boss as all efforts to reach him have proved abortive. They are worried that he has remained incommucado since he entered the Presidential Villa after being issued the invitation of the presidential investigation panel by the DSS.
Magu was widely reported to be arrested on Monday afternoon by the DSS. The Department of State Services (DSS), however, later denied arresting the EFCC acting Chairman. The DSS had in a statement by the Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, on Monday explained that the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, had on Monday, honoured an invitation by a Presidential Panel reviewing the activities of the EFCC at the Banquet Hall wing of the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
The DSS said that Magu was served the invitation to the Panel, while on his way to the Force Headquarters, Abuja, for a meeting.
The DSS accordingly, declared that, “The EFCC’s boss was neither arrested nor forced to honour the invitation;” adding that, “A member of a legal team from the EFCC is also with him on the Panel.”
