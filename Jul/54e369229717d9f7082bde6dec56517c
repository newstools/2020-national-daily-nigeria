It can only take a wicked heart to imagine that a ‘Judas Iscariot’ still lives among men in today’s world or how can one explain the situation where an apprentice will sell out the live of his master.
The report reaching National Daily reveals that the owner of Popular Chucks Supermarket, Nicholas Offodile in Lokoja who was killed by Kidnappers was confessed to have been murdered by an alleged hired assassin, Vincent Omogor.
The weirdest thing in the ugly saga is that Omogor who hails from Asaba, Delta State confessed that he and others were contracted to Kill Offodile by an apprentice who works in the Supermarket.
The Kogi State Commissioner of Police, Ede Ayuba disclosed this to newsmen in his office today while parading 28 criminal Suspects.
Vincent Omogor said the apprentice who contracted them said he was angry with Chief Offodile for refusing to give him money to treat his sick father who later died.
“He now gave us his travel itinerary which made it easier for us to kill him on Abuja road”.
The CP said a manhunt is on to arrest other members of the gang.
He said the arrest was made possible by the effort of men of SARS alongside vigilantes from Orehi village in Kogi LGA.
