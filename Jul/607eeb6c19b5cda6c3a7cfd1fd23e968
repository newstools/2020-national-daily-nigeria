Raymond Igbalode (aka Hushpuppi) and Olalekan Ponle (aka Woodberry) will continue their lifestyle of dicing with crime and police and playing smart even after their arrest.
The slight difference is they won’t be cruising around in their fast cars totting up to N3.2bn—and might have to shack up elsewhere different from the luxury apartment where  N168bn worth of UAE currency was stashed.
The Dubai Police on Thursday handed over the Nigerian Instagram celebrities and UAE-based advanced free fraud artistes to the FBI, and both have been ferried out to the US to face trial for defrauding close to two million people, mostly Americans.
According to a statement by FBI Director, Christopher Wray, the bureau praised the exceptional efforts exerted by the United Arab Emirate, represented by the Dubai Police General HQ, in combating transnational organised cybercrime including the recent arrest of Raymond Igbalode Abbas, known as “Hushpuppi” and Olalekan Jacob Ponle aka “Woodberry”.
The suspects, alongside others, scooped up in the Operation Fox Hunt, were said to have committed money-laundering and multiple cybercrimes.
According to the police, 13 luxury cars, estimated at 35 million dirham (N3.7bn) were recovered from the house.
