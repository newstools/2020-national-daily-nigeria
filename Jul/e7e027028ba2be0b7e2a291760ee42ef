The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, on Monday stepped down as the House Committee Chairman investigating the allegations of financial malfeasance in the commission.
Tunji-Ojo withdrew from the continued investigation after the NDDC acting Managing Director (MD), Daniel Pondei, last Thursday walkout on the committee accusing the committee chairman of corruption.
Pondei had led other management staff of the commission out of the House  while accusing Tunji-Ojo of corruption; thus, insisting that his team will not speak before the committee presided by Tunji-Ojo.
Tunji-Ojo stepping down on Monday, stated that he still has the support of his colleagues, but preferred to step aside in order to give all parties a fair hearing. The lawmakers had passed a vote of confidence on the committee chairman after Pondei walked out of the House.
The House went on a 30 minutes break after the NDDC MD fainted during the investigation session. Meanwhile, the lawmakers have resumed sitting.
