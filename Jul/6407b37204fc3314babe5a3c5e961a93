No fewer than 601 former Boko Haram terrorists, including 14 foreigners from Cameroon, Chad and Niger, were re-integrated into society on Saturday in the ongoing Operation Safe Corridor by the Nigerian military.
The Coordinator, Operation Safe Corridor, Major General Bamidele Shafa made the announcement on.
The former fighters were freed at the DRR Camp in Mallam Sidi, Gombe State.
General Shafa said on arrival at the camp.
“The clients went through documentation processes to obtain vital background information and were subjected to comprehensive medical screening to determine their health status,” said Gen. Shafa.
According to him, their DNA samples were also collected and biometrics captured by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) for future references.
“The background information serves as a guide for the experts, Local Treatment Team (LTT) to properly place the clients for treatment therapies and vocational training.”
He added that LTT are specialised experts in various fields of deradicalisation and rehabilitation therapies drawn from the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS).
The Nigerian military authorities have been deradicalising and re-integrating terrorists who surrender and desire to renounce the group.
But many Nigerians believe the former killers deserve no mercy.
