The travail of the embattled acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, is beginning to unveil some political colouration to towards 2023. A source close to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) revealed to National Daily that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, purportedly sold  a dummy to the perceived cabal in the Presidency that the embattled former EFCC Chairman, Magu, is allegedly being controlled by the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, thus, surrendering the control of the commission to the southwest. Our source added that the Justice Minister argued that if Magu is not removed now, it will be difficult to stop Tinubu in the 2023 presidential race.
The party source further told National Daily that the Minister succeeded in convincing the perceived Aso Rock cabal in the skirmishes over the removal of Magu as EFCC acting chairman. Apparently, Malami has the support of the cabal in the fight against Magu who has also reactivated his alliance with civil society to strengthen his fight back and self defence. Accordingly, several civil society groups have been cautioning the Buhari administration of endangering the fight against corruption with the battle to remove Magu.
Meanwhile, Tinubu is yet to make official pronouncement of his 2023 presidential ambition. However, several ad hoc campaign teams have been mobilizing support for the APC national leader for the 2023 presidential race. Tinubu had neither denied the ad hoc groups nor admonished them to desist from their informal campaign activities. Perhaps, this deepens the suspicion or belief in Tinubu’s 2023 presidential ambition which hypothetically, precipitates counter activities or covert oppositions.
National Daily investigation shows that there are also other conflicting interests between Malami and Magu over the battle for the control of the EFCC. Details in subsequent reports.
