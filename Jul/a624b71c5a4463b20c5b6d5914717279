A former national deputy publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank has said ongoing probe of the Niger Delta Development Commission [NDDC] by the House of Reps has vindicated his position on the APC.
Recall that the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, while appearing at the public hearing of the investigative panel set up by the House of Reps to probe the corruption allegations against him and members of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC, accused members of the National Assembly of being the beneficiaries of most of the contracts from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).
While responding to questions on the expenditure during this period of a forensic audit, he said you cannot close down the NDDC because of the security implication on the region. He pointed out that those that have done jobs for the commission should be paid while revealing that members of the national assembly were the greatest beneficiaries.
When a female lawmaker interrupted his presentation and asked what benefits the lawmakers get from the contracts, the minister said, “I just told you that we have records to show that most of the contracts in the NDDC are given out to members of the National Assembly.”
Reacting to the various allegations leveled against the minister and top executives of the NDDC, Frank, who had since dumped the party and apologised to Nigerians over the role he played at ensuring that the APC emerged as the ruling party in 2015, described the APC as a disgraceful party full of corruption.
On his verified Twitter handle, @RealTimiFrank, the former APC chieftain wrote: “APC Govt is a disgrace, full of corruption. I’ve been vindicated again by Akpabio’s revelation on this 9th APC Assembly.
“From Akpabio’s comment, it has shown that this 9th APC Assembly are partners and the biggest beneficiary of the ongoing Fraud at the NDDC. We need an answer now.”
