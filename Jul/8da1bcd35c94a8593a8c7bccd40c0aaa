The Deputy Governor of Edo state, Philip Shaibu, on Wednesday told the former chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), that his kneeling down before traditional rulers will not save him and his anointed candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu from imminent defeat in the forthcoming governorship election in the state.
Oshiomhole on Sunday night in Benin City, begged for forgiveness for selling Obaseki to the people of the state in 2016 and promised to right his wrongs during the forthcoming Edo governorship election.
Shaibu, during a campaign that started from Akpakpava Road in Benin City, through Ekpoma to Jattu, in the Etsako West Local Government Area of the state, said no amount of stunts like that will prevent APC’s candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, from defeat.
“No amount of kneeling stunt will save the former national chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, and his candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, from defeat,” Shaibu said.
The Deputy Governor also claimed that he scheduled several peace meetings with Oshiomhole without success, before the former APC National Chairman masterminded their disqualification from contesting in the primaries.
