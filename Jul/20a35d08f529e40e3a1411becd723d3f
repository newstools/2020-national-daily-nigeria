The EFCC acting chairman Ibrahim Magu is facing an investigative panel following allegation by AGF/Justice Minister Abubakar Malami—that the Magu is insubordinate and shady in his handling of recovered loot.
While the investigation goes on, the PDP is asking President Muhammadu Buhari to prove his sincerity in fighting corruption by asking Magu to step aside s the commission boss.
In a statement shared on its official Twitter handle on Monday, the opposition party said the development confirms malfeasance in EFCC.
“The PDP holds that the development around the @officialEFCC acting Chairman as well as the desperate attempt by the Commission to cover or wave off his investigation, only raise more integrity questions regarding Magu’s activities in the EFCC,” the statement read.
“Only last month, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minster of Justice, Abubakar Malami, released a memo in which he indicted Magu of alleged diversion of recovered funds and fraudulent sale of assets seized by the @officialEFCC.”
The PDP said  it is monitoring the development as it joins the international community in demanding that Buhari should muster the courage to carry out a comprehensive investigation and make its findings available to the public.
“Moreover, with the allegations and investigation, Magu has lost the moral rectitude to continue to preside over the anti-corruption agency. He should step aside until he proves himself innocent,” the party said.
Magu’s EFCC has prosecuted and secured the conviction of prominent members of the PDP, including its former national publicity secretary Olisa Metuh serving jail time now.
News broke earlier on Monday that the DSS arrested and detained Magu.
But the commission in statement same day said it wasn’t true the chairman was arrested, but that he went to honour the panel’s investigation.
