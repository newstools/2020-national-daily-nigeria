50 party lovers were nabbed by officials of Kwara Technical Committee on COVID-19, in the early hours of Saturday. The arrest were made at a nightclub in Ilorin, the state capital for violating the ban on nightclubbing.

Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee on COVID-19 in the state, Dr. Femi Oladiji, disclosed this on Saturday in Ilorin at the state’s quarantine centre, where the suspects were kept.

Oladiji explained that the operation was led by the state’s Deputy Governor and Chairman of the Technical Committee on COVID-19, Mr Kayode Alabi.

According to Oladiji, “around 1 a.m., we got information that some people were clubbing at a hotel.

“The deputy governor, accompanied by some security officials, raided the club and we arrested so many boys and girls within the age range of 20 to 30.

“Around 2a.m., we brought them to the Hajj Camp (quarantine centre). We made them comfortable overnight, and early this morning, we took their samples for COVID-19 tests.

“The arrest, which may lead to prosecution, is to send the signal that we cannot tolerate such conduct. Violations will, henceforth, attract strong response from the government.”

He said the ban on night club activities remained in force in the state to prevent further spread of the virus.

Oladiji added that the nightclubbers violated the Kwara State Infectious Diseases Regulations, 2020, as well as government’s subsisting ban on congregation that is beyond 20 people, except in places of worship.

He pointed out that the government was considering other measures, including enforcement of the use of face mask in public, to flatten the curve of transmission of the virus.

“Government will take appropriate actions against any official of the hotel found to have authorised the violation of the existing ban.

“This is to send the signal that such behaviour will not be tolerated,” he added.
