The Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Bashir Jamoh, has pledged to go tough against untrained boat skippers who endanger passengers’ lives.
He made this vow during a courtesy visit to the agency by the General Manager of the Lagos State Waterways Authority, Oluwadamilola Emmanuel.
Jamoh called for the harmonisation of standards and procedures between both bodies to ensure safety, according to a statement issued by NIMASA on Sunday, titled ‘Non-conventional Vessels: NIMASA promises tougher action against untrained, uncertified boat skippers’.
The LASWA general manager, on his own part, promised to share information regarding maritime safety with NIMASA.
