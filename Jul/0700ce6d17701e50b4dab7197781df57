Vows to vote Obaseki





Thousands of members of the Ibo Women Community in Edo state on Thursday have declared their support for the Peoples’ Democratic Party, vowing to vote for the party in the forthcoming governorship election in the state.
The women led by Mrs. Blessing Ahoruonye said they were joining the PDP so they can offer maximum support to Governor Obaseki in appreciation of the excellent work he is doing.
She referenced the elimination of double and over taxation by thugs in the previous APC government and stopped since the start of Godwin Obaseki’s administration.
She also mentioned the impressive developmental stride been witnessed in the state as well as the economic expansion that has positively influenced the rate of consumption and his prudent management of resources.
She expressed fear that if Governor Obaseki’s Administration is disrupted, the state will go back to the “hands of thugs, brutal tax collectors and servicing of God fathers at the detriment of development and ease of doing business.
She rejects the return of the state to a party immersed in corruption while citing recent NDDC and EFCC allegations amongst other.
