The fireworks over the Edo State governorship electioneering campaign has begun.
The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council, Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State, for the Edo State governorship election of the party’s candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, is being awaited with public opprobrium in the state. The APC campaign committee chairman may be visiting Edo State with questionable integrity burden over the allegations of stuffing dollars in his pockets in the alleged $5 million contract bribe in Kano State.
As the warfare for the governorship electioneering campaign garners momentum in Edo State, a billboard relaying the video where Governor Ganduje was allegedly packing dollars into his pocket has been mounted at the biggest roundabout in the State Capital, Benin City.  The signal exposes the APC campaign team to public ignominy as the various political parties prepare to swing into full stream of campaign in Edo State. Hypothetically, APC may be going to Edo State with baggage of political liability on the integrity of the campaign chairman and the team.
