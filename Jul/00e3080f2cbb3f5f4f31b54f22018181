The Red Devils fans endured a painful Monday night as United squandered the opportunity to leapfrog Chelsea and Leicester City into the top three on the EPL log.
The Old Trafford side threw away two points in their 2 – 2 draw against Southampton at dead end of their encounter on Monday night to remain fifth on the table.
The development has seen United still outside the UEFA Champions League position considering Manchester City’s success with CAS over turning their initial UEFA Champions League ban in its verdict on Monday morning.
Meanwhile, the Red Devils fans can finally have reason to celebrate if the report reaching National Daily on Jadon Sancho transfer to Old Trafford is something to be trusted.
Jadon Sancho has remained a key target for United

It has been revealed that Manchester United have reportedly agreed a £85million transfer fee with Dortmund to sign Jadon Sancho.
The England international has remained a long time Red Devils target, and the club were expecting to pay upwards of £100m to get their man.
But National Daily can confirm from a revelation by Bleacher Report, that United have negotiated themselves a deal that remains under the club-record £89m spent on Paul Pogba.
