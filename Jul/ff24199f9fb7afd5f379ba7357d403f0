The Nigeria Security And Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Delta State Command, Has Impounded Three Trucks Loaded With Stolen Crude Oil And Arrested Over 11 Suspects In The State.
The NSCDC Commandant, Chile Ikpeamaonwu who stated this on Thursday in Asaba, said the command had also secured three convictions within his first hundred days in office.
He noted that the current COVID-19 pandemic affected his take-off as the state commandant, noting that his vision to move the command forward has been delayed.
He said, “Over the past three months, the command impounded three trucks loaded with stolen crude oil and also arrested 11 suspects.
“The current pandemic has affected my take-off and information gathering, as you know that our work is more on surveillance.
“So, we, therefore, had to revive the Asaba Marine Team of the Anti-Vandalisation Unit of the Corps at River Niger in Asaba.
“These have helped the command curb vandalism in the state, as I speak to you now, the rate of vandalism has reduced drastically.
“The command has also trained and mobilized officers in the discharge of the lockdown enforcement duties.
“We also trained five agro rangers under the command and sent them to Edo State to assist the emergency going on in the state.”
He said that the command had intercepted a lorry carrying about 80 persons who violated the inter-state lockdown while a three-week-old baby was also rescued.
