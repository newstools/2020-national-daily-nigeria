The deceased Braimoh until his sudden demise was the House Committee Chairman on Information,security and strategy who made copious contributions to state developmental policy debate on the floor of the house,a well rounded personality.

According to a colleague of his Hon.Victor Akande who represents Ojo counstituency 1 at the state Assembly while speaking on phone with this correspondent earlier today,note that the late Braimoh was a very cautious individual whose loss made him sleepless.

He said: “It is true my brother,I could not sleep since 1am when I learnt about his demise,he is one of those who never toyed with his health matters.

“Highly cautious and will always maintain strict adherence to all medical counsels from the appropriate quarters as it concerns prevention of this spread of COVID-19 scourge.

“He would be sorely missed, he was such a fine breed whose impact will ever remain a point of reference”.

Hon. Hakeem Sokunle the House Health Committee Chairman who later called this news correspondent hinted that the late Braimoh died of COVID-19 also and might have contracted it from late Senator Bayo Osinowo with whom he was a close confidant.

” We have been battling it for a while now before his sudden demise. It is so sad we eventually lost him.

“It is assumed he may have likely contracted the virus from late Pepperito with whom you are much aware he was a close confidant, it is confirmed he died of COVID-19.” Hon Sokunle submit.
