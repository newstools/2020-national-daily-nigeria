The Edo State Government on Saturday  condemned the attack on the State government’s  guests who include governors and other Very Important Persons (VIPs), at the Oba’s Palace in Benin City, prequel to the flag-off of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s re-election campaign for the September 19 governorship election.
The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, in a statement alleged that the thugs were sponsored by the All Progressives Congress (APC), its governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and the sacked APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who he said had in the past few days engaged thugs to cause mayhem in the state.
Crusoe Osagie declared: “We are appalled by the deployment of thugs to the sacred grounds of the Oba Palace by the APC, Ize-Iyamu and Oshiomhole to harass guests who are in the state for the flag-off of Governor Obaseki’s campaign and had visited the palace to pay obeisance to His Royal Majesty, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, the Oba of Benin.
“While we respect the boundaries of politics as it relates to the Palace, it is reprehensible that the APC, its candidate and their enablers would sponsor thugs to desecrate the palace, which is a clear case of desperation to score cheap points.
“This conduct is not a trait of Edo people and is condemned in the strongest possible terms, as we are courteous and welcoming to guests. It is obvious that these persons were mobilised for this task by those who have no regard for the palace nor want the progress and development of the state.”
Several men and women sustained gunshot injuries from the attack.
