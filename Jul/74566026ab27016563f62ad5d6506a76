The Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, says it has uncovered a plot by the Edo state government to detain the former National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole on trumped-up charges on the eve of the September 19 Governorship election in the State.
Hon. Patrick Obahiagbon, the Vice-Chairman, Media and Publicity Committee, of the APC National Campaign Council, who made the accusation at a press conference on Sunday, also said alleged that there is a plan to set fire on the farm of billionaire businessman, Captain Hosa Okunbo for refusing to back the second-term agenda of Governor Godwin Obaseki.
Hon. Obahiagbon said: “Worse still, information have also reached us from sources in Obaseki’s government who are but disillusioned with his nefarious acts, that the governor has plotted and perfected a criminally appalling initiative aimed at subverting the will of the people.”
He alleged that Governor Obaseki is planning to use COVID-19 as a ruse to neutralize grassroots leaders of the APC on the eve of the gubernatorial election by abducting and detaining them in isolation centers—this way, disenfranchising them and forestalling the political force they would deliver in pursuant of APC’s victory.
“Having read the handwriting on the wall that he faces a monumental defeat and an electoral opprobrium on the 19th of September, Obaseki aims to illegally strike what he deems the head and important political leaders of our party with the hopes of subverting the election.”
“Names of prominent leaders of the APC have been compiled to be dealt with, intimidated, harassed, terrorized, physically assaulted, and lacerated by state-sponsored goons.”
He condemned the “anomalies and acts of political desperadoism” as “direct affronts on the country’s constitution and the rule of law” while also appealing to the Police, INEC, and other relevant stakeholders to prevail on the Governor and ensure that he allows the rule of law and a level democratic playing field to hold supreme between now and the end of the Edo governorship elections.
