Share this on WhatsAppThe Edo State Government has noted that the commissioners in the state Development Commission who resigned their appointments are not members of the State Executive Council.
The Special Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, in a statement on Monday indicated that members of the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission (EDSOGPADEC) are not part of the Edo State Executive Council.
“This is to clarify that the resigned Board members of the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission (EDSOGPADEC) are not members of the Edo State Cabinet.
“This clarification has become necessary, in order to correct the erroneous impression in the public domain that members of EDSOGPADEC (an agency of government) Board are civil commissioners of the Edo State Government,” Osagie declared.
The Commissioners were identified to include: Prince Emmanuel Odigie, representing Edo Central, Alhaji Aiwanu Oshiomhole, representing Edo North, and Osamwonyi Atu, representing Orhionmwon in the Commission.
The S.A. Media admonished media houses to take note of the clarification.
Osagie observed that “though these board members are sometimes referred to as commissioners, a title they share with their counterparts on the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), they are however, not civil commissioners of the Edo State Government that assist with the day-to-day running of the government.”
It was earlier on Monday reported that three Commissioners of Edo State Oil Gas Producing Area Development Commission (EDOSOGPADEC) resigned their position, and declared support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
It was reported that Hon. Osamwonyi Atu in his resignation letter stated that his decision to leave the Obaseki-led government was to attend to family issues which has become necessary.
