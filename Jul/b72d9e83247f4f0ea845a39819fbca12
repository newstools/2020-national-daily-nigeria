The Action Democratic Party (ADP), has refuted claims by the Edo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),that ADP structures in the state has collapsed having merged with it,calling on Nigerians to disregard the misinformation.



The ADP National Publicity Secretary,Prince Adeoye Adelaja
in a quick response,faulted the claims of PDP as baseless and unfounded.
 
 “ADP is participating fully in the upcoming election in Edo State, and have not at any time, entered into any kind of merger, coalition or arrangement with the PDP or any other political party.

“Those parading themselves as members of our great party in the State, claiming to have defected with others, have no record on our membership list, and as such cannot be said to be our members.

“ADP further warns that, any body impersonating and fraudulently using the name of our great party ADP, to swindle people will be handed over to the law enforcement agencies, for prosecution in the court of law.”

The party also use the opportunity to alert the innocent public, not to fall for the PDP’s antics.

“In the interest of the public, it is important to make this clarification, for people to disregard the machinations of political jobbers, who are always moving from one party to the other at every election cycle.

“ADP is certain of victory in the poll and have assured it’s members across the country and in diaspora that, there is no cause for alarm.” Adelaja added.
