The fireworks of the electioneering campaign for the September 2020 governorship election in Edo State has commenced in earnest as INEC has formally declared open campaigns for the election.
Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Chairman of the Edo PDP Campaign Committee has fired back at the I integrity-laden Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State who on Monday threatened that Wike will be sent to isolation centre while the APC will win the governorship election before his recovery.
Governor Wike took to his twitter handle ridicule the alleged corruption profile of Governor Ganduje. Governor Wike wrote: “I won’t join issues with Ganduje because we’re not at the level. People should stop comparing us.  I have never been caught in a videotape stuffing dollars into my pocket. In fact, all my cloths have np pockets. I’m responsible citizen unlike him.”
Ganduje is the chairman of the APC campaign council which was inaugurated in Abuja on Monday for the Edo governorship election.
The Edo governorship campaign is expected to generate monumental drama.
