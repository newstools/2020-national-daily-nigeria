There are revelation confirming Lagos Hon. Tunde Braimoh, whose death was announced earlier Friday, was killed by covid-19.
A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hakeem Shokunle explained Braimoh got the virus from the late Bayo Oshinowo, a federal lawmaker from the Lagos East Senatorial District that died of the viral infection weeks ago.
Braimoh and Oshinowo were allies, according Shokunle.
“It is assumed he may have likely contracted the virus from late Pepperito with whom you are much aware he was a close confidant. It is confirmed he died of COVID-19,” he stated.
Other Lagos lawmakers lamented it was unfortunate Braimoh, who was highly cautious in taking Covid-19 precautions, eventually died of the complications.
A member said they had been battling for weeks to save Braimoh’s life since he came down with the infection.
Fear now grips other who might ave come in contact with the late lawmakers.
