The Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has begun presentation in defence of the allegations of impropriety in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) under his supervision. He refuted that no N40 billion is missing in the NDDC.
The Chairman of the Committee had requested the Minister to present his documents and speak for about 15 minutes, then, the lawmakers may ask one or two questions. Akpabio resisted the Committee Chairman, noting that allegations have been made against him, adding that he has family and friends. He protested that some persons have appeared before him and given time of between one hour thirty minutes to speak against him. He told the Committee chairman that he was a Senate Minority Leader before becoming a minister.
The Committee chairman, however, assured that the investigation was not to witch hunt anybody, clarifying that they need to save time.
The Minister, then, commenced his presentation.
He denied forcing the former NDDC MD to take any oath.
He noted that when he became Minster, there was no budget in the NDDC, and therefore, money could not be spent without a budget.
He, therefore, denied that he ordered anyone to bring N10 billion to share in December. He declared that the allegation is false.
