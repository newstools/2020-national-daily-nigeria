A 10-year-old girl, Emmanuella Mayaki who is a coding and programming genius has recently received her first job at the Southfield Primary School in Coventry, England, as the after school coding club teacher!
It was gatherded that Emmanuella will be responsible for teaching other kids her age about the basics of coding including HTML and CSS.
The school selected her for the job because of her extraordinary skill and knowledge in the area.
Mayaki’s passion for technology started at 7 years old.
At 9, she obtained a diploma with a specialty in multiple software programs. She is still actively learning other coding languages and programs.
National Daily learnt from Face 2 Face Africa that Mayaki said that there are currently about nine pupils in her club. Hopefully, the club will increase its members in September.”
She explained that her Academy App among others is already on Google Play store where I pass on knowledge of coding and graphics. I remember at age seven, I set a target to become a professional web designer and analyst at age nine, and I have accomplished it.”
“In the first week, I was pretty nervous because I had never taught a group of children. Although, my experience was sublime because I gained experience and I also enriched my skills. My observations were that not everyone grasps how to do it on their first try and there are some that they rush through it in a breeze.”
