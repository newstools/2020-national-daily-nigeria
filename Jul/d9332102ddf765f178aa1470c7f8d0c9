Two media Aides to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa including Public Relations Officer (PRO) Government House Press unit and forty three others have tested positive to Covid-19 Pandemic disease in the state, leaving fear of the unknown to have heightened

The media Aides: Nelson Egware, a Senior Special Assistant ( SSA) media, Fidelis Egugbo, Special Assistant ( SA) media, and Kingsley Obiajuru, Public Relations Officer ( PRO) Government House Press unit tested positive to Covid-19 Pandemic disease on Wednesday after their samples were collected and forwarded to Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo state for screening

Recall that the state Governor Ifeanyi Okowa who tested positive with his wife and daughter to Covid-19 Pandemic disease, ordered a total screening for all workers in Government House including the press unit insisting that those who refused to go for test shall considered his or herself sacked

Confirming this to Journalists in Government House on Wednesday, the Chief Press Secretary ( CPS) to the Governor, Mr Olisa Ifejika said that the two media Aides and the Public Relations Officer ( PRO) were screened four days ago, adding that unfortunately, they tested positive to Covid-19 Pandemic disease

He said, ” It’s unfortunate that two media Aides: Nelson and Fidelis Egugbo have tested positive to Covid-19 Pandemic disease and they will immediately Commenced treatment at the Isolation Center.

“We must adhere strictly to the rules and when the Governor ordered that all the workers in Government House Press unit should carry out test for them to know their status, we comply immediately, we have shutdown the Press unit and we are working on line until everyone is treated for the virus, especially for those who tested positive”

Meanwhile, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu has described as pathetic poor attitude of many Deltans to the rules and regulations to curtail the Covid-19 Pandemic disease warning that the virus is real and can kill easily if not detected in time

Aniagwu said, “As I speak with you Journalists now, over 15 of Smart Delta Press unit have tested positive and they have been quarantined and have started treatment immediately, I have been treated and I am now we’ll, but I am pained that some people in the state are saying that there is no Covid-19 Pandemic disease, the virus is real and people are dying.”

The information commissioner who briefed Journalists on measures to strengthen the curtailment of the virus, disclosed that the state government would enforce the use of face masks and social distancing with the help of security agents.

“We are also going to monitor the activities of churches unlike we were not doing before, this time around, we will enforce the rules and when schools reopen the same we will do to reduce the increasing rate of the virus, especially in the urban areas where the upsurge has been frightening”
