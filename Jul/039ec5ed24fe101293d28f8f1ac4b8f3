Facts are beginning to emerge on why Johnson and Johnson (J&J) announced the discontinuation of its Talc-based baby powder in the US and Canada in May, 2020.
National Daily gathered that the decision has to do with the campaign by National Women’s Health Network that exposure to talc has been linked to ovarian carcinomas, gynecological tumors, and mesothelioma.
The NWHN has fiercely advocated against the use of talc in cosmetics and personal care products, launching a high profile campaign for stronger regulations, testifying at the FDA and before Congress, publicizing J&J’s efforts to market baby powder to Black women and other women of color in the U.S. after internal documents revealed that they knew the product could be dangerous, and highlighting numerous discoveries of other asbestos-tainted talcum cosmetics products marketed to women and young girls.
In an article on its site, NWHN explained that independent labs throughout the US and over the course of several decades have documented the presence of asbestos in consumer talcum products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder.
“J&J’s decision will reduce unnecessary exposure to harmful chemicals to millions of people in North America, especially Black women and women of color who have been aggressively targeted by J&J. This is an important step in the right direction,” explained M. Isabelle Chaudry, the NWHN’s Senior Policy Manager.
According to NWHN, while the company continues to defend talc-based baby powder, their discontinuation of the product acknowledged that their advocacy campaigns about talc’s dangers played a role in “declining demand due in large part to changes in consumer habits and fueled by misinformation around the safety of the product.
The NWHN also advised J&J to halt sales of its talc-based baby powder worldwide and to recall existing inventory here at home.
“We also call on other companies engaged in manufacturing talc-based products to take action and do what is right for consumers.
