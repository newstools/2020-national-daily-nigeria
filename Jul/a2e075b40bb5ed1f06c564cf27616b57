Following reports that alleged internet fraudster and Instagram socialite, Raymond Igbalode Abbas (Hushpuppi) has been released from custody, his lawyer, Gal Pissetzky, said his client is yet to be released.
Recall that Hushpuppi and Olalekan Jacon Ponle (Woodberry) were extradited to the United States after their arrest in Dubai over allegations of committing crimes outside the UAE, including money-laundering, hacking, criminal impersonation, cyber fraud, banking fraud and identity theft.
Pissetzky’s disclosure came after reports made the rounds on Wednesday night that the socialite had been released as his details on the Bureau of Prisons showed he was no longer in the prison.
However, Pissetzky, in a statement, confirmed that the embattled socialite was only transferred to another prison but not released as widely speculated.
The lawyer also confirmed that he is still representing Hushpuppi.
“Just because the jail record says ‘released’ does not mean he has been released. He is being transferred to California. He is on his way to California, United States of America, for trial. …” Pissetzky said.
According to authorities in Dubai, incriminating documents were found of planned frauds worth a total of $435 Million.
Also seized in the arrest were $40.9 million in cash, 12 luxury cars valued at $6.8 million, 21 Computer Devices, 47 Smartphones, 15 memory sticks and five hard disks containing 119,580 fraud files as well as addresses of 1,926,400 victims.
