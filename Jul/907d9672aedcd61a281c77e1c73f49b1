The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), says it has uncovered a plot by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to use Gov. Umar Ganduje of Kano, Hope Uzodinma of Imo state and Yahaya Bello of Kogi to rig the September 19, 2020, Edo state governorship election.
Recall that the APC had earlier announced its campaign team with Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano state as the head.
But in a statement at the weekend, spokesman of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that the trio of Governors Ganduje, Hope Uzodinma of Imo state and Yahaya Bello of Kogi State were mandated by the APC to “derail” the Edo election.
“Part of APC’s plot is to import election mercenaries as observers to attempt to scare the people of Edo state, suppress them and steal their mandate.
“The PDP and indeed, the people of Edo state are already aware that the trio were selected by the APC to lead its campaign so as to force a combined formula of Kano and Kogi electoral violence as well as Imo state mandate robbery to subvert the will of the people of Edo state in the governorship election.
“It is however not surprising that such is the drift of the APC campaign, given that it has neither messages nor plans for the people of Edo state.
“Whereas our candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, enjoys the overwhelming support of the Edo people due to his enthusing track record of personal character and performance in office for which even APC leaders have praises for him, the APC candidate has nothing to present to the people,” the party said.
