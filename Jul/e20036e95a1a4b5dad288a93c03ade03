For the third time, Boko Haram’s terrorists ambushed the convoy of Borno Gov Babagana Zulum, and the ecounter was bloodier this time.
According to sources, Zulum was on his tour of LGAs in the state, distributing relief materials and welcoming the displaced back when his convoy ran into the attack around Baga on Wednesday.
Baga is one of the most dangerous terrain in the Boko Haram-infested northeastern state.
At least fifteen persons following him were wounded, though the attack was subdued by the security operatives in the governor’s convoy.
Zulu, however, continued his tour apparently because nobody got killed.
