The ousted national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and embattled godfather of Edo politics, Adams Oshiomhole, on Sunday came out of his brief political holidays, declaring his mission to unseat incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and enthrone Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu as his successor in the September 19, 2020, Edo governorship election.



National Daily captured Oshiomhole in a tweet on his twitter handle on Sunday where he declared that his mission is to return Edo State to the path of sustainable development, which he felt Obaseki has failed to do. The former APC chairman noted that his silence since his removal as APC national chairman was not an act of cowardice. He berated Obaseki, declaring that the Edo governor has no agenda for the governorship election, noting that Ize-Iyamu has been selling his Simple Agenda to the people of Edo State but Obaseki has been selling propaganda.
National Daily accordingly, reports that Oshiomhole in his tweet declared: “I have only one mission and I know it is our common mission to bring Edo Back to the paths of Sustainable Development.
“One with God is majority, keeping calm is not always an act of cowardice.
“While Pastor Ize-Iyamu is busy selling his Simple Agenda, letting people know his plans for Edo State, Obaseki is busy selling propaganda because he has no agenda to sell, he never had any at any time.”
National Daily follow up on the Edo election found that meanwhile, Governor Obaseki has sustained wide communication and interactions with the people of Edo State rendering account of his first tenure and reassuring them of a better second tenure. The contest is clearly between Obaseki and Ize-Iyamu, including Oshiomhole.
However, Oshiomhole may be using this comment to build his return to the public space after wide circulation of his strong demarketing of Ize-Iyamu in 2016 which many people in Edo State and beyond also believed. Invariably, Oshiomhole may be struggling with marketing Ize-Iyamu who is sponsoring in the September election to the people of Edo State.
