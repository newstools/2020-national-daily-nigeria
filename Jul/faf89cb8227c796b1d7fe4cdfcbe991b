The Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker, RT. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has described this year’s Eid-el-Kabir, as a unique one owing to the adverse effect of COVID-19 scourge ravaging the globe, on individuals, religion and the economy of nations, Nigeria inclusive.

This year’s annual Islamic celebration according to the Rt.Hon.Obasa is a pointer to Muslims in Nigerian and the world, that God deserves to be praised by all in whatever situation we are, as stated in His commandments.

Obasa who is also the chairman of the Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures in Nigeria,assert that the world should see its present predicament as a call to get closer to God through humility, respect and love for neighbours.

The Speaker congratulated Muslims who are alive to witness the celebration and urged them to remain conscious that “we all exist not by our strengths but by God’s grace.

“Within the year, many of us have lost loved ones; we have also had moments of downturn, but God has been our strength at such periods.

“As we mark this celebration, let us remember our brothers and sisters in need, let us remember the true meaning of love for one another and above all, we must all draw closer to God, who knows the end from the beginning and whose grace we constantly seek.”

The Speaker, who commended Lagos State and the Federal Government over the way they have handled the pandemic, pleaded with citizens to continue to adhere to medical instructions, including the use of face masks, sanitizers and washing of hands at required times.

“Adherence to instructions is one of the best ways we can collectively return our society to normalcy,” Said Obasa.
