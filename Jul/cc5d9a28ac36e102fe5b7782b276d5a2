Arsenal begin a run of challenging fixtures with a trip to Molineux as they prepare to take on fellow European hopefuls Wolverhampton Wanderers in Saturdayâ€™s Premier League showdown.
The two clubs both enjoyed victories and clean sheets in their most recent fixtures, with Wolves overcoming Aston Villa 1-0 last weekend while Arsenal inflicted a 4-0 thrashing on Norwich City in midweek.
Presiction: Wolverhampton Wanderers to win or draw and over 2.5
The clash between Wolves and Arsenal promises to be a fascinating tie between two sides vying for a spot in Europe next season. Both clubs are heading into the weekend in a good run of form and will believe they are equally capable of coming away with all three points, but we cannot pick a winner for this one and are backing a high-scoring draw at Molineux.
