The Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Effurun branch in Delta State, has allegedly alleged that CAMA 2020 Act was smuggled into the law establishing the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, through the backdoor, vowing to challenge its passage in court.
Recall that the new Company and Allied Matters 2020 Act, CAMA, was signed by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 7.
The NBA President in Effurun, Mr. Jonathan Ekperusi Esqmade, disclosed this on Thursday during a remark when he led members of the legal profession on a courtesy visit to the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Warri Correspondents’ Chapel.
He said part “C” which is a controversial provision of the CAMA law gives the Registrar -General of the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, the power to strictly regulate religious bodies including Islamic groups as well as charity organizations and their existence.
According to him, the Registrar-General has the powers to suspend trustees of an association or a religious body and appoint an interim manager or managers to coordinate its affairs without recourse to a court of law.
He said, “That’s too draconian. CAC does not need the court again. They’re now the prosecutor and the judge. No sane society should allow that to happen. That cannot stand. The NBA will challenge that obnoxious law. It is for the ease of doing business. They use the provisions of part “A”,” B”&”C”.
While noting that there is a time bomb in part “C” of the CAMA Act 2020, Ekperusi said, “We will approach the Court. Those sections will be struck out,” he assured.
