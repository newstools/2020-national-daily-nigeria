Justice Minister /Attorney-General Abubakar Malami and IGP Mohammed Adamu aided the 14 lawmakers-elect (APC) and three others in impeaching Edo House of Assembly Speaker Frank Okiye and his just elected deputy on Thursday.
A letter marked HAGF/IGP/202/Vol11/4 just surfaced and there  Malami wrote to Adamu to provide security for the APC lawmakers when Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki and his loyalists sealed and vandalized the state house of Assembly.
The governor’s action effectively prevented the lawmakers loyal to Adams Oshionhole and the APC candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu from holding the impeachment meeting.
In the letter entitled ‘Re: Urgent and nationalistic appeal to intervene in the restoration of constitutional democracy in Edo State of Nigeria,’ written to the IG, the AGF said he was acting on the letter written by Messrs West Idahosa & Co., requesting his intervention.
“I am requesting that you kindly provide adequate security measures for the purpose of the inauguration of the concerned members and the subsequent sittings of the Edo State House of Assembly,’ the AGF added.
In the flurry of events on Thursday, there was a new inauguration on Thursday of the lawmakers-elect who refused to be inaugurated in 2019.  Okiye and his deputy, Rolland Asoro, were also impeached, and Victor Edoror was elected as Speaker.
Many Nigerians now wonder how the APC-led federal government will be neutral in the forth-coming election without bringing the federal might to crush Obaseki and his party.
