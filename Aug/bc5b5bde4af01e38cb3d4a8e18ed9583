Manchester United have not hidden their desire to land Jadon Sancho from Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund.
Previous reports claim that the Old Trafford club have made Sancho their number transfer target, but have recently missed out on the August 10 self-set deadline by Dortmund for the England sensation transfer.
United have been reluctant to meet the £108million transfer fee demanded by BVB, thus leaving the two clubs miles apart on the transfer evaluation.
The Red Devils fans have put the executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward in the firing line as another United transfer saga drags on, but the report reaching National Daily from The Athletic reveals that it is the United chief Joel Glazer who has stood firm on his reluctance to meet Dortmund’s €120 million asking price.
Woodward and chief negotiator Matt Judge have been conducting talks via intermediaries drafted in by Borussia Dortmund with the two parties still some way apart on their fee and no thanks to Joel Glazer for his strict position.
