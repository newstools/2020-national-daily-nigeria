There are palpable fears in the camp of the All Progressives Congress, Edo state chapter as about 5,000 of its members have reportedly defected to the Peoples Democratic Party, expressing their support for the re-election bid of its candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki.
One Honourable John Bobby Palmer led the 5,000 APC members to declare their support for the PDP Ward 6, Ubiaja, in Esan South-East local government area.
The former APC leader commended Obaseki for prioritising the welfare and wellbeing of Edo people against the interest of a few selfish politicians.
According to one of the defectors, “Governor Obaseki has a great vision for the state and we have seen that in his policy choices. If you look at the wickedness of the APC in the last 4yrs, their failed promises, you will quickly vote for the PDP in Edo unless you want failure to continue.”
Another defector who simply identified himself as Ozino Porter said: “Obaseki is the best governor in Edo state since Ambrose Ali. For the first time in Edo state, we have a responsible government that is led by a responsible citizen, Godwin Obaseki who says he wants a departure from the old ways.”
“The residents of Edo state had seen what Governor Obaseki has done which is evident. Removal of Obaseki is equal to the change of 2015 that all Nigerians are lamenting today,” he added.
In his own statement, John Bobby Palmer said Oshiomhole wants Obaseki out because he is jealous. Governor Obaseki’s performance in this first term has completely obliterated the once-celebrated achievements of Oshiomhole, gradually eroding his fame into the garbage of history.”
“The forthcoming election in Edo state is going to be peaceful. The opposition party wants Edo people to believe it would be a do or die affair so as to scare Edolites from coming out in numbers to vote for Obaseki. They know they can only win PDP by rigging, but not this time.”
