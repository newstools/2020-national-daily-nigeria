As far as Ohaneze knows, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Igbo are in sizzling romance, and any person or group criticizing or suing him doesn’t have its blessing.
That’s the position of the pan-Igbo group, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, on Sunday.
Their commendation of Buhari followed the re-opening of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu after one year of closure.
The group said the reopening is as an “affirmative action that Buhari’s love for Igbos is unparalleled”.
“OYC wishes to categorically state that we have the mandate of Igbo elders to persuade those who unjustly used Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s name as signatories to the ongoing suit against President Muhammadu Buhari without proper consultative approval from the various stakeholders to withdraw,” the group said in statement Sunday.
“Igbo Youths salute the Southeast Governors Forum for the harmonious relationship between them and President Muhammadu Buhari irrespective of the rogue operations of few Igbo groups to label them saboteurs.’
Among the few Igbo groups that believe Buhari hates the southeast and its development is IPOB, an outlawed group headed by Nnamdi Kanu seeking secession.
There are scores of other fringe organisations the frequently carpet the APC government for its alleged ant-Igbo stand.
This is not to mention very important politicians like Senate Minority Leader Eyinaya Abaribe and others who mix opposition with regional activism.
The group noted that the action of the president has contradicted critics whose interests are to paint the federal government as enemies of Igbos and sectional in the distribution of amenities
