The Federal Government has shifted resumption of international flights billed for August 27 to September 5.
The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) announced this on Thursday.
It can be recalled that the Federal Government had closed the Nigerian airspace to both domestic and international flight operations except for essential services in March 2020 as part of the measure to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus disease.
However, domestic flight operations resumed on July 8, with Lagos and Abuja airports and subsequently other airports. Sirika said there had been no confirmed virus transmissions on flights.
