National Coordinator of the group, Olusegun Bamgbose who disclosed this in a chat on Sunday pointed out that Northern politicians such as Tanko Yakassai, Paul Nnongo, Balarabe Musa, Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Senate President Ahmed Lawal and others have spoken the minds of the people in the region which Atiku should respect.
“Tanko Yakassai, Paul Nnongo, Balarabe Musa, Governor El-Rufai, Ahmed Lawal and others will forever be respected and reckoned with, in the scheme of things,” Bamgbose said in chat with DAILY POST on Sunday.
“They are the new faces of great Nigerians. They deserve to be commended for standing for what is just and equitable.
“They have actually spoken the mind of the North. It’s on this basis, I’ll humbly urge Atiku Abubakar, to shelve his presidential ambition come 2023 Presidential elections.
“He should respect the views of these noble, patriotic and detribalised Northerners. In 2007, I kicked against the third term of Olusegun Obasanjo, this is well known to Atiku.
“The best bet for him is to support a Southerner to emerge as the next President of Nigeria, come 2023. His name will be written in gold, if he will summon the courage to do this.
“When it comes to holding this nation together, the North should be respected. As President, the North will never for one day regret they supported a Southerner, to emerge as President.”
