Juventus will be aiming to overturn a 1-0 deficit when they welcome Lyon to Turin for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash on Friday.

A first-half Lucas Tousart goal was enough for Lyon to triumph in the first leg before the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the sporting landscape.

Neither Juventus nor Lyon finished their domestic campaigns as strongly as they would have hoped, but Juventus have proved themselves as a force to be reckoned with at home and could be boosted by the potential return of Dybala.

However, following the recent match against PSG. Lyon have shown that they can cause trouble. So we see this match ending in favor of Lyon.
