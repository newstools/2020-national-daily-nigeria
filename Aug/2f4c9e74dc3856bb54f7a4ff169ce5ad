“This meeting is to enable us as a  commission to interact and brief stakeholders on the level of preparations for the forthcoming bye-elections.

“We are also mandated to adhere strictly to the COVID -19 guidelines. This is very necessary because we have a constitutional obligation as an essential service provider to conduct elections.

“In line with this constitutional provision in carrying out our duties, we should not be seen as agents of distributing the virus to others. Wearing of face mask at the polling units and all elections locations is mandatory”, Pai said.
