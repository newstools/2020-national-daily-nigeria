Arsenal have already secured the services of Brazilian great Willian from Chelsea in the quest to fortify their midfield.
Interestingly for the Gunners fans, report reaching National Daily reveals that Arsenal have already won the race for signature of yet another top Brazilian Gabriel Magalhaes from Lille.
It is understood that the defender look set to undergo a medical today.
National Daily gathered from the report by The Telegraph Arsenal have emerged victorious with their bid to land the in-demand Lille centre-back having agreed a £22.6million fee.
 
A five-year deal for the 22-year-old defender at the Emirates has been claimed with further reports claiming that he is set to finalise the deal with his medical.
Meanwhile, the defender could be having his medicals back in France due to the coronavirus restrictions before completing his move to the Premier League.
National Daily however understands that the young Brazilian was heavily linked with Napoli, who also had a bid accepted, but latest development now favours Arsenal after Magalhaes has spent the week deliberating on his future in view of the offers on the table for him.
There is no doubt that fans at the Emirates club will be excited with the progress Arsenal are already making in their bid to reposition the club.
