Following the tribunal judgment that upturned PDP’s Gov Duoye Diri’s victory on Monday, the Bayelsa APC have fanned out to celebrate the judgement.
They APC crowd marched through some areas in Yenagoa, the state capital, carrying banners and chanting victory songs.
Their joy may be short-lived, though because the PDP has vowed to appeal the judgement.
Last November, the APC candidate David Lyon was declared by INEC to have won the state governorship election.
But the legal battle that followed the declaration went as far as the Supreme Court where it was eventually upturned—because Lyon’s running mate presented academic documents the apex court faulted.
The court therefore declared the next runner-up—the PDP—winner on the eve inauguration.
However, the latest twist was introduced at the Election Petition Tribunal where the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party alleged INEC wrongfully exclude the party from participating in the election.
Consequently, the tribunal upturned Diri’s victory, ordering INEC to conduct a fresh election within 90 days.
