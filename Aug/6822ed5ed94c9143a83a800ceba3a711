Nigerians are expressing concerns over the invitation of a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, by the Department of State Services to its office in Jos, Plateau State after his revelation of the secrets of Fulani killings in Southern Kaduna. Stakeholders of goodwill in the Nigerian project cautioned that the DSS should not intimidate Mailafia into silence and suppress him from speaking out for his people on the perennial killings in Southern Kaduna which now constitute a serious threat to national security in Nigeria.
National DailyÂ gathered that Mailafia on Tuesday confirmed his invitation by the DSS to its office in Jos, Plateau State.
The former CBN Deputy Governor in a media interaction had revealed that the Boko Haram terrorists and bandits tormenting the northeast, northwest and north central are the same criminal gangs; saying that there is no difference between them. He had alleged that the government is doing little to tame them, adding that both the federal and Kaduna State governments have abandoned residents of Southern Kaduna to the bloodshed feast of the Fulani militia.
Mailafia further alleged that they were privileged to interact with some repentant Boko Haram terrorists who revealed that a governor in the north is a commander of Boko Haram. He further alleged that the Boko Haram and bandits were supplied sophisticated arms and are scattered over the country, including the south. He further revealed that from the rural invasions and killings, they will move to phase two where they will start killing selected important personalities in the city.
The former CBN deputy governor also alleged that they have planned to declare civil war in Nigeria in 2022.
Mailafia, former presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (AFC) in the 2019 general elections, insisted that the DSS invited him on Tuesday to report at its office in Jos at 12 noon on Wednesday.
