Manchester United forward, Tahith Chong, has left the club to join German side Werder Bremen.
Werder Bremen disclosed this in a tweet via its official Twitter page on Sunday.
The Dutch winger was officially unveiled as a Bremen player on Sunday afternoon after he agreed a season-long loan away from Manchester United.
Chong played 12 times in all competitions for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season, with his most recent appearance coming in the Europa League last 16 second leg versus LASK at left back.
The 20-year-old rose through the ranks as a right winger but Bremen manager Florian Kohfeldt admits Chong ‘has potential for development’ in a defensive aspect.
“He’s a very technically gifted player who can play on both wings,” Kohfeldt told the official Bremen website. “He’s also really fast, which will help our game. Defensively he has potential for development – he’s still only at the start of his career and we want to help him continue fulfilling his potential.”
