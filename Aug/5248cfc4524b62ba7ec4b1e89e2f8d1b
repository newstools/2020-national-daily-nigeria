AGF Abubakar Malami has made a written defence to his boss President Muhammadu Buhari who has been inundated with petitions alleging abuse of office and corruption by the justice minister.
In the defence, Malami argues “Nigeria’s law doesn’t preclude one from gaining the fruit of my establishments”.
According to him, he was already made of money before Bhari made hi minister.
In the letter, Malami noted that he listed 27 properties in his asset declaration form submitted to the Code of Conduct Bureau.
“Among other things, I owned lucrative business ventures of Rayhaan Hotels and Rayhaan Food & Drinks, both in Kano, since December 13, 2013, years before the 2015 election that saw to the victory of President Muhamadu Buhari as the President and long before I was appointed to be a Minister in the first term,” he said.
The suspended EFCC chairman Ibrahim Magu under interrogation indicted Malami in his defence too. The media and anti-corruption NGOs also recently documented instances and properties that suggested the minister is corrupt.
His letter to the president might just be an indication the heat is on him, too as the Justice Ayo Salami panel widen its probe of the anti-corruption war from 2015 till date.
The EFCC is a agency under the AGF.
Malami and Magu  have been fighting a superiority battle since 2015, leading to a tome of allegations Malami submitted recently to Buhari.
