The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released the data of registered voters in Edo State in which 1,000 votes discrepancy was detected. Some stakeholders were perturbed at such error at this elementary stage of the supervision of the Edo governorship election by the INEC.
Meanwhile, INEC released the following PVCs’ figures for the September 19, 2020 governorship election in Edo State:
Total Voters
2,210,534
Gender distribution:
Male
1,159,325
Female
1,052,209
Districts:
Edo South
1,281,414
Edo North
564,122
Edo Central
364,998
Uncollected PVCs
483,769
There is a difference of 1,000 votes in the gender votes distribution released by INEC. Accordingly, the Total Male PVCs plus Total Female PVCs amount to 2,211,534, while the INEC released total is 2,210,534.
However, the districts votes distribution corresponds with the INEC total registered voters of 2,210,534.
There were, therefore, demands on INEC to reconcile the figures; recalculate the numbers and give the actual figures to avoid suspicions of rigging and manipulation of the governorship election.
