Before now, tens of Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki’s followers left him in the lurch, and moved over to the APC until Tuesday when things turned around, and a larger defection hit the Osagie Ize-Iyamu camp.
More than 5, 000 of APC’s members in the Esan East LGA, Ward 6, suddenly realized Obaseki is the leader they want. They crossed over to the PDP under the leadership of Hon. John Bobby Palmer.
Leading the members, Palmer said the decision was to secure the reelection of Governor Obaseki and ensure the consolidation of his administration’s achievements.
“Obaseki has done well in his first term and because we love good things, we have no choice but to join the party which stands for development,” he said.
