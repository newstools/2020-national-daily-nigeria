Bayelsa Gov Douye Diri has been sacked by the state election petition tribunal.
The tribunal equally ordered INEC another election to be conducted within 90 days.
Diri, a distant third to the APC candidate David Lyon, got into office following a Supreme Court judgement that upturned Lyon’s victory.
The apex court sacked the APC candidate based on the controvesial certificate of his running mate.
But the election tribunal discountenanced Diri’s victory in a different petition the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party (ANDP) brought against INEC.
The party argued that it was unlawfully excluded from participating in the poll.
In Nigeria, the Supreme Court decisions are final–and precedents for future adjudication.
That a lower court found a way around it will stoke a lot of legal crackers in the coming days.
The PDP has yet to respond officially to the development.
