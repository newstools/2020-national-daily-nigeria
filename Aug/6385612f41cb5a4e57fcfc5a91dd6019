Ronaldinho and his brother, Roberto de Assis are close to securing their release from a Paraguayan prison, after their defence team agreed a plea bargain.
Recall that the Brazilian football star was arrested in March for entering the country with a false passport
The public prosecutor’s office asked to close the investigation against the two brothers and a judge will now fix a final hearing to confirm the terms.
The plea bargain included a guilty plea from the two men for entering Paraguay with fake passports and fines of $90,000 and $110,000 respectively, for Ronaldinho and Roberto.
Roberto agreed to a criminal record in Paraguay, but Ronaldinho’s record will be clean there.
The plea deal also stipulates that Ronaldinho can leave Brazil at any time, though he must tell Paraguayan officials how long he will be away. Roberto is not permitted to leave Brazil for two years.
The brothers must also present themselves to a federal judge in Brazil every three months during a period of two years.
