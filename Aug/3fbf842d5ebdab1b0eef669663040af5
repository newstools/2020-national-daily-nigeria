It was a disastrous Friday night for Juventus fans around the world as the Old Ladies crashed out of the UEFA Champions League despite their 2–1 over Olympic Lyon. The result saw them finishing 2–2 on aggregate, but were unable to progress following their opponents’ away goal advantage.
Sequel to their abysmal outing, Juventus have decided to terminate the services of Maurizio Sarri as the outcome of the meeting of the Continassa hierarchy ushered the end for 61-year old former Napoli manager.
Juventus have gone ahead to announce Andrea Pirlo as their new boss for the next two years hours after sacking Sarri despite his inability to have managed at any level previously.
It will definitely be a massive challenge for the 41-year old Pirlo who was only named Juventus’ Under-23 head coach last month.
It is understood that Juventus had hired Sarri after he was able to guide Chelsea to their Europa League title because they were eager to challenge for the UEFA Champions League; an ambition that further saw them engaged the services of former Real Madrid talisman Cristiano Ronaldo especially after their several years of narrow-misses to the title.
A club statement read: “Juventus announces that Maurizio Sarri has been relieved of his post as coach of the first team.
“The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus’ history with the victory of the ninth-consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football.”
National Daily understands that Sarri’s future had been previously called into question despite leading the club to a ninth-successive Scudetto, with the former Chelsea manager having to admit himself that he had been struggling to impose his famous ‘Sarriball’ style on the squad.
