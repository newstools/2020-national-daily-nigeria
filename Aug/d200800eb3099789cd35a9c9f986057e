A Magistrate Court in Kaduna State on Thursday set free two of the three suspects being prosecuted for the accident that led to the death of Nigeria’s first female helicopter fighter pilot, Flying Officer Tolulope Arotile.
It was gathered that the Magistrate released the two suspects, Folorunsho Igbekele Faith and Gbayegun Deji, after going through  the  Police investigation report which did not indict them of any crime, as well as the legal advice from the Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecution, which also indicated that they have no case to answer.
The two suspects were identified as the only passengers and friends of the first suspect who was driving the vehicle.
However, the first suspect, Nehemiah Adejor, is being be charged for culpable homicide and criminal conspiracy, though, not to be punished with death if found guilty.
National Daily gathered that when the case commenced  at the Magistrate Court 1 on Thursday, the prosecution Counsel, DSP Martins D. Leo, demanded the court to discharge the second and third suspects, noting that investigation did not indict them of any offecne.
The DPP had noted in his submission at the court that there is no premeditation in the death of the Flying Officer Arotile, however, insisted that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute the first suspect, Nehemiah Adejor, for culpable homicide not punishable with death.
The presiding Magistrate, Benjamin Hassan, in his judgement, discharged the second and third suspects, relying on the police investigation, which did not find them wanting in addition to the legal advice from the state’s Director of Public Prosecution, Bayero Dari, which indicated that they have no case to answer.
Yoruba leaders had protested that the late female Air Force Pilot did not die of normal accident but was murdered. The vehement protest from the southwest led to the investigation of the accident and the ongoing prosecution of suspects.
