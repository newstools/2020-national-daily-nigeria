Ayomide Taiwo, 20, was attacked by a policeman six days ago. He slipped into a coma right on the scene of the attack at Ilahun, Osun, and he never came out of that twilight zone until his uncle announced his death Sunday.
According to Uncle Segun Adeola, Taiwo, a fashion designer, died around 8am at Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo where he was receiving treatment.
Taiwo and his friend Wasiu Oladimeji, the uncle said, were travelling on their motorcycle to Owena on Tuesday when some policemen from the Ibokun Division, Obokun LGA, stopped them for a bribe.
Oladimeji said one of the officers, Insp. Ago Egharepbe, drunken, saw a bundle of N50, 000 when Taiwo wanted to pay the amount the cop demanded.
“The drunken policeman suddenly approached us and hit Ayomide’s head with the butt of his rifle,” said Oladimeji.
“The two of us fell from the motorcycle while the three other policemen ran away.
“Ayomide was lying unconsciously on the floor and was bleeding in his nose, mouth and ears. I carried the bike off him.
“Another policeman who was not at the scene when it happened helped in carrying my friend to Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo.
“Ayomide has been in a coma since we took him to the hospital because of the head injury he.”
According to him, the DPO gave them N30, 000 for the hospital bill.
“We don’t know how to tell her that the last child she celebrated Eid-el-Kabir with some days back, is now dead,” the uncle lamented.
The state police command said the officer has been dismissed.
“Commissioner of Police Osun command, Undie Adie, had after receiving the report of the trail committee, recommended the dismissal of the officer to the Inspector General of Police and he has been dismissed,” Yemisi Opatola, the command’s spokesperson said.
He will be charged to court on Monday with murder.
