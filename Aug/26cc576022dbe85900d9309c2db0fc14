The traditional ruler of Ugboha, in the Esan South-East local government area, His Royal Highness Steven Ukato Odijie, has declared his support for Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state.
The monarch on Monday in his palace when he received the governor, assured Governor Godwin Obaseki of the unflinching support of the people of Esan land, citing the governor’s sterling performance across the state.
He said: “Come September 19, 2020, Edo people will express their appreciation for the governor’s achievements by re-electing him. Thank you for your good work for Esan people; my people and I will support you. You will get our support to continue with your developmental strides across the state.”
On his part, Governor Obaseki thanked the people for their support, promising to bring more developmental projects to the community if re-elected.
Recall that commercial activities were halted temporarily in the city as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) supporters staged a massive walk which they termed the Umbrella March, to reinforce their support for the governor at the weekend.
The march, which was organised by the Edo Voters Volunteers Assembly (EVVA), a grassroots voter mobilisation body, had over 2,000 participants.
