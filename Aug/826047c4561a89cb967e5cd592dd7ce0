The corruption petition filed against the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, on Change.org by a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has received over 10,900 signatures within three hours.
Omokri had earlier filed the petition, accusing Tinubu of corruption and called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe the APC chieftain.
A media report quoted Tinubu’s aide, Tunde Rahman as responding to the development by saying that the APC leader would react to the petition by Omokri.
In his reaction to Rahman’s reponse, Omokri wrote on his Twitter handle, @renoomokri: “Dear Bola @AsiwajuTinubu, I am waiting for you. We are all also waiting to see if the @OfficialEFCC will do the right thing by investigating you for money laundering.
“We can’t be intimidated. We are stakeholders in this country.”
A visit to Change.org before this report was filed showed the petition against Tinubu by Omokri had received over 10,900 signatures within three hours.
It remains to be seen if the anti-graft agency would respond to the calls based on the petition.
