The petition urging the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to investigate a former Governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, crossed 10, 000 signatures in just one day. And set a record, as no political petition on Nigeria has reached such numbers in so short a period of time. However over 16,000 Nigerians have now signed the petition on Change.org (http://chng.it/47LfHWwH).

The petition was launched by a Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri. A vocal critic of the Muhammadu Buhari Administration, Omokri titled the petition “Calling on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to investigate Bola Tinubu for contravening the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act of 2011, by having bullion vans ferry alleged large sums of money into his house on the eve of the 2019 Presidential election”.

The Petition which had about 16,200 signatures as at Friday morning has gone viral. Below is an accompanying statement made by Omokri on the petition’s page; “Dear citizens of Nigeria, let’s take our country back by signing this petition to compel the EFCC to investigate and prosecute Bola Tinubu for contravening the Money Laundering Act, by ferrying bullion vans into his house. Don’t say ‘na today’, or ‘leave matter’.

“We as Nigerians must stop confusing cynicism for wisdom. If we do not fight for our country, who will? George Floyd’s death sparked a revolution in America and we joined. We did not say ‘na today’, or ‘leave matter’. You and I can make a difference with this petition. #EFCCMustInvestigateTinubu.”

It will be recalled that Tinubu has since responded to an inquiry about the Bullion vans pictures entering his Bourdillon home last year. He told a reporter that he was free to give anyone money since he was not holding any government position.
