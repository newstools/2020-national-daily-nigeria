The Northern Governors Forum on Friday appeared to disagree with President Muhammadu Buhari that enough is being done by the federal government to tackle the increasing insecurity in Nigeria. The Northern Governors decried the attack on the convoy of Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State by unknown gunmen. The governor lamented that the attack was callous and reprehensible.
Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, in a statement on Friday accessed by National Daily acknowledged the attack on Governor Zulum’s convoy who was on his way to Baga, a commercial town in Kukawa Local Government Area, to personally distribute relief materials to internally displaced persons for the Sallah celebrations, noting that it was another desperate attempt by criminal elements to sabotage the efforts of the governor towards reducing the suffering of vulnerable people who have been traumatized by terrorists.
“This regrettable attack shows the desperation by enemies of peace and humanity at large to jeopardize all efforts towards making life easier for victims of violence in the state over the years.
“The Northern Governors Forum strongly condemns this attack and stands with Governor Zulum who has demonstrated courage in personally reaching out to people in need despite the dangers. We urge him not to deterred as he keeps working with security agencies to protect the lives and properties of the people,” Governor Lalong declared.
