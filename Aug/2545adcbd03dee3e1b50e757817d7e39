Barcelona fans endured an embarrassing night on Friday as the Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich debased the Catalan club in a humiliating 8-2 defeat to oust them out of UEFA Champions League.
The devastating result has left many calling for an urgent rebuilding of the aging squad to the excitement of the fans.
The Spanish giants were at a receiving end of a masterclass in finishing as Bayern smashed unbelievable eight goals past Barcelona in a one-sided affair in Lisbon where Bayern scored four in the opening 31 minutes.
The heavy defeat that saw Barcelona crash out of the Champions League in a devastating fashion had left a tearful Gerard Pique considering his future.
Pique speaking to Forward Barca after the match maintained that: “It’s a horrible result. An embarrassment.”
 
“This club needs changes, and I don’t mean the manager, or any specific players. I don’t want to single anyone out. It needs changes.
“This is the bottom.”
“We have hit rock bottom. If I have to leave for new blood to come, I will leave.
“We do not compete in Europe or the league. It cannot be masked anymore.
“It is a shame, I can’t say anything else. It’s not the first or the second time. The club needs changes of all kinds.”
“Right now we feel enormous frustration and all we can do is make conclusions and think about the future”.
 
“Barca is a club that is so great that this will cause us a lot of damage and obviously some things will have to change. The truth is this is a tremendously painful defeat.”
The former Real Betis boss admitted that his future as head coach was out of his hands following “a humiliating and painful defeat”.
He said: “Barcelona want to recover their identity.
“Right now, it’s too soon to think about whether I will stay or not. It doesn’t depend on me.
