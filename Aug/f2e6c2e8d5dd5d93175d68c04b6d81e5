The ousted national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has come under the bashing of the APC governors again. The governors under the aegis of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) have warned that Oshiomhole is so desperate to use the Edo State governorship election to manipulate his way towards regaining the national chairman of the party.
National Daily learnt that the Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman, raised alarm that Oshiomhole and his associates are making fresh plots to regain the national chairman of the party. Lukman was of the view that the desperation has blinded Oshiomhole and his associates in the APC from handling the governorship campaign in Edo State in accordance with the electioneering regulations or stipulated laws. He added that the ousted national chairman and his team have thrown fair play and the rule of law to the winds, imposing their idiosyncrasies to win the Edo governorship election at all costs.
Salihu Lukman, DG of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), alleged that the ousted chairman and his collaborators are plotting to frustrate the APC Interim Caretaker Committee from succeeding in arranging for the APC national convention for the election of new members of the National Working Committee (NWC), including a new national chairman, who will run the administration of the party henceforth.
National Daily gathered that Lukman in a letter to the APC Interim Caretaker Committee disclosed that the plot of the former national chairman is channeled through compelling the party’s caretaker committee suspend further actions, using the Edo governorship election as bargaining instrument.
The PGF DG, Lukman, had last Friday cautioned APC that Oshiomhole’s campaign approach has been making the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) more popular in the preparations for the Edo governorship election and weakening the APC and its candidate. He had also complained that Oshiomhole has hijack the electioneering campaign from the APC candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
