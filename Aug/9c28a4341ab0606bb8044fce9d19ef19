It is commendable that since the outbreak of incessant attacks in Southern Kaduna, Pope Francis has fervently prayed for Southern Kaduna, the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), Rev. Yakubu Pam has said.

Rev. Pam stated this in a statement at the end of strategic stakeholders meeting with states chairmen and secretaries of states Pilgrims Welfare Boards of the North Central and North West Zones, held in Jos, on Wednesday.

According to him: Pope Francis has contributed immensely in the current peace in Nigeria’s Southern Kaduna and I am full of gratitude for his earnest prayers for peace to rain in the country.

“I wish to commend him also for putting forward modalities that will see to a lasting peace in northern Nigeria.

“We are however, delighted with the role he is playing to ensure that Christians stand strong in their faith for one indivisible Nigeria”, he said.

Speaking further, the Pilgrim Chair, said his coming on board as the NCPC boss will redirect and reposition the Commission, adding that a new record will be set.

“I call on spiritual fathers in the country to join hands with me for the restoration of the dignity of the Christian faith.

“All stakeholders from the North Central and the North West should partner with us to enhance the spiritual growth of Christians in the regions”.

He however, commend the Northern Governors for the sponsorship of Christians to pilgrimage and applauded Plateau state Governor, Simon Lalong for sponsoring the highest number of Christians to pilgrimage in the region in 2018 and 2019.
