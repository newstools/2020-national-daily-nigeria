Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, son of the late Federal Finance Minister, Chief Festus Okotie-Eboh, says the Edo/Delta people who made up the former Midwest region are tired of being spectators in the leadership dance, insisting that 2023 is the turn of the region to produce the country’s president.
Okotie-Eboh who disclosed this in a recent interview said it is only fair that the next president should come from the old Mid-west region of Nigeria (made up of present Edo/Delta states), and not the Southeast as is being canvassed.
“Do not get me wrong, my reference to the Midwest is based on the four regions that we operated from 1963 to 1991. It is either we are zoning or we are not
“I have heard arguments in some quarters stating that it is the turn of Ibos to become President of Nigeria. Assuming this will hold water, it is only fair that the Ibo man should come from the only region (Midwest region) which has not produced the President.
“I have always told my friends that zoning breeds greed, tribalism, insecurity, stealing, nepotism, laziness, underdevelopment which ought not to be the norm. However, it’s our right and our turn to produce the next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
“As it is now, the latest and most recent regions that have ruled Nigeria are the South and North. It appears that’s the way they want power to continue moving in our country, but we are not having it. We insist on the initial four regions and out of these four regions, it’s only the Midwest that has not enjoyed power at the top level. We deserve to have it now, since it has gone round the other three zones severally.
“The Ibos are complaining of marginalisation, but which region has been more marginalised than the Midwest in the history of this country? We are being treated as second-class citizens, and that most change,” he added.
