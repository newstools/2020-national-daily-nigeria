Share this on WhatsAppSpiritual leader of the INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Monday, has revealed what may happen to the incumbent governor of Edo state and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Governor Godwin Obaseki if he fails to win the governorship election in the state.
In a statement on Monday, Primate Ayodelen warned the state governor against being relaxed, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate should fight against every form of manipulation.
He said Obaseki should unleash his arsenal to fight against manipulation and disenfranchisement in the election.
Primate Ayodele warned that Obaseki may end up in jail and his political career gone if he fails to win the election.
The statement reads: “People are supporting Obaseki but those people might not be allowed to vote, he needs to be rugged else he will be eased out, if he takes any simplicity method, he will lose out.
“There will be manipulations in the election. If he isn’t careful, his victory will be given to someone else, even if he appeals the case, he won’t be given. He must not allow manipulations in the election. If he loses, he will be forever irrelevant in politics.
“They have already prepared the manipulation process to ease him out, he shouldn’t be carried away by the crowd he sees at the moment, He needs to work against the manipulation technically and pack his arsenal together to battle against APC and Ize Iyamu.
They will want to steal of ballot boxes, they want to disenfranchise people, he must have committed people in polling units, he shouldn’t accept anything inconclusive, if he allows Ize-Iyamu to win, he is gone politically and jail is waiting for him, he should ensure he wins, because if he thinks the court will later rule in his favour after the election, It’s won’t work, it’s better he wins right from the election than taking Ize-Iyamu to court.”
