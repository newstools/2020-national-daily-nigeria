According to a report, an agreement between Real Madrid and Everton over the transfer of Rodriguez could be less than 48 hours away, with the Colombia international expected to undergo a medical later this week.
The deal would see Rodriquez join forces with Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti at Goodison Park for a third time, having played under him at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in the past.

Rodriquez, who earns around £200,000 a week at Real Madrid, has been deemed surplus to requirements by the Los Blancos coach, Zinedine Zidane.
The 29-year-old struggled for games last season, making just 14 appearances for the La Liga champions in all competitions.
Rodriquez, who has 12 months left on his Real Madrid contract, is keen to sign a three-year deal with Ancelotti’s side.
Meanwhile, last month, Ancelotti was asked about the possibility of signing Rodriquez, but the Toffees boss played down the prospect that any genuine approach had been made for the forward.
 “James Rodriguez? I like him a lot as a player. When I left Madrid, James Rodriguez followed me to Munich. He came to play,” Ancelotti said.
“But he followed me as a rumour to Napoli, and now he’s following me here to Everton as a rumour.
“I have to be honest. I like him a lot. But he is a Real Madrid player. I think he’ll still be a Real Madrid player.”
