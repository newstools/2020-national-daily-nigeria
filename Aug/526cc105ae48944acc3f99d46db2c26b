Barcelona fans who were still attempting to deal with the disappointment that came with their pathetic UEFA Champions League 8-2 thrashing by Bayern Munich last week woke up on Sunday morning with the more devastating news of their talismanic Lionel Messi set to quit Camp Nou.
Understandably, the last bitter truth they have struggled to accept through the years is the end of the Argentine football career at Camp Nou. Majority of football pundits have wasted no time to argue that Messi has remained the soul of Barcelona for over a decade.
The 6-time Ballon d’or award winner who has been central to Barcelona’s remarkable success through the years has been disgruntled recently having grown frustrated at the lack of planning at the Catalan club.
National Daily gathered from the claim by Esporte Interativo that Messi who comprehensibly cut a deserted figure after Barcelona were dropped by Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final on Friday night has finally decided to quit Camp Nou immediately.
More agonizing for Barcelona fans is another report from the Spanish publication Sport that Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu is planning a mass clearout at the Camp Nou this summer with only four players reported to be kept by the club with the rest all available for transfer.
National Daily can further confirm that Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Clement Lenglet, Frenkie de Jong and Lionel Messi are the only players believed to be pardoned with the expectation of them to be retained at the club.
However, it is left to be seen if Messi will eventually remain or quit Camp Nou as Barcelona fans would rather wish for former.
Meanwhile, several clubs like Manchester City and Inter Milan have been reported to be lining up interest for the Argentina captain.
