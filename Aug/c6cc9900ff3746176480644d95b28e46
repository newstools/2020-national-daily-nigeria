Some supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are beginning to protest perceived imbalance in the war against corruption by President Buhari, agitating that there appears to be a sort of reward on corruption allegations for party members on political patronage. They argued that President Buhari endorsed Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu as governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State with a liability of N700 million allegation received from  Dasuki but former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Oliseh Metu, is in Kuje Prison for receiving N400 million from the same Dasuki.
The APC supporters decried that the anti-corruption war has become an issue of “Same story, different strokes”, protesting that the APC tag appears to be a licence of freedom in the anti-corruption war.
The supporters took to a social media platform to protest: “former PDP spokesman, Olise Metuh, is in Kuje Prison for receiving N400 million, while Ize-Iyamu who received N700 million from Dasuki is the APC governorship candidate in Edo.”
