A non-governmental organization, the Global Centre for Media and Human Empowerment, has said with the perpetual killing of the people of southern Kaduna, the Governor of the State, Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai may exit power like the former German politician and leader of the Nazi Party, Adolf Hitler.
Leader of the group, Charles Ejoh while addressing a world press conference on “State of the Nation” on Friday in Jos, said the NGO is pained with the insecurity in Kaduna State because of its peculiarity.
According to him: “what we are experiencing in Kaduna is a genocide. The systematic wiping of a people, we may give recourse to history on how Germany in the hands of Adolf Hitler systematically wiped out over 6 million Jews during the holocaust.
“With the pretentious approach of El-Rufai, we may wake up one day to discover that the entire Southern Kaduna has been wiped away using government machinery.
“The holocaust that wiped away over six million Jews started like this. First it was said that the anti- semitic Nazi Hitler’s hatred for the Jews was a major reason. Hitler said Jews were an inferior race, an alien threat to German racial purity and community, just like what we are experiencing in southern Kaduna since the emergence of El-Rufai”, he said.
However ,indicting the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong as culprit, Ejoh alluded that Lalong who also doubled as Chairman of the Northern Governors’ Forum is “insensitive” to the plight of the Southern Kaduna people, thereby called on him to resign his position as Chairman of the region.
“Northern Governors’ Forum is a betrayal of the trust of the people which is sending a wrong signal to other regions of its inability to secure its people”, Ejoh said.
