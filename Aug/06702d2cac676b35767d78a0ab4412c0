The governor vowed that he would appeal the judgement of the tribunal nullifying his election. Governor Diri disclosed that he has instructed his lawyers to file the necessary papers of appeal.
Governor Diri, immediately after the tribunal delivered its judgement that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) wrongly excluded the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party (ANDP) governorship candidate in the November 2019 election, stated that he has implicit confidence in the judiciary, noting that he would survive at the end.
The Bayelsa governor declared: “We trust in the judiciary and we are appealing the judgement. With God on our side, we will get justice.
“This is a court of the first instance and I have instructed our lawyers to file an appeal. We have a right to appeal even up to the Supreme Court.”
