Former Manchester striker and legend, Rio Ferdinand has ruled out the possibility of Barcelona FC reaching the finals of this year’s Champion League final.
The former English player said he expects Paris Saint-Germain to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League finals later this month.
PSG will face Atalanta in tonight’s Champions League last-8 fixture, while Bayern Munich will tackle Barcelona on Friday.
The Ligue 1 champions defeated Borussia Dortmund over two legs before the coronavirus lockdown, Bayern eliminated Chelsea from the competition.
“I want Paris Saint-Germain to get there [Champions League final] because of the likes of [Kylian] Mbappe and Neymar. You want them glamour players to be there,” Ferdinand said on BT Sport.
“And I’m going for Bayern [Munich] with the way they have been performing over the season.”
