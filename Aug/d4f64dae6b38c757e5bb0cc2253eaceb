The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may have succeeded in reducing the ousted national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, to political impotency in Edo State, according to the Chairman of the State Campaign Council, Dan Orbih.
Dan Orbih at the PDP campaign rally in Igarra, Akoko Edo Local Government Area, emphasized that former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, is a man that has lost his political relevance, urging not to take Oshiomhole seriously.
National Daily gathered that the PDP Campaign Council Chairman disclosed  that loyalists of Oshiomhole in Edo State government have been making demands on Governor Godwin Obaseki on behalf of their principal, adding that the governor resisted them, cautioning that he would divert funds for the development of the State to any other purposes.
Orbih at the commencement of PDP in the 192 wards of Igarra, Akoko Edo Local Government Area, declared: “those Oshiomhole put in Government have been making demands on the governor: ‘Give us Edo State Government money so that we will stay with you. But the governor told them, ‘If you want to go, go. Edo State money is for the development of Edo State.”
The chairman of the state Campaign Council assured the people of more economic development, job creation and infrastructure. He reiterated that government funds cannot be diverted to a few individuals in the state or their external collaborators.
