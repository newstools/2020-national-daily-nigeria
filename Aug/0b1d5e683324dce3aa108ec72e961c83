Share this on WhatsAppYou remember Frank Edoho? That anchor of WWTBAM show that didnt change outfit like Lady gaga, no fake accent and was able to keep us glued to NTA (yeah, NTA).



According to Mayor of Abuja (@TravizTall), “Of course, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was the only thing parents didn’t have to force their kids to watch on the NTA network. As someone who begrudgingly watched a lot of the 9 P.M Network News, I know this to be true. And yes, Frank Edoho was the life and soul of the show.”

“Frank Edoho is who every TV host aspires to be like. Hyundai, Kia and the other new generation cars can be very flashy and nicely designed, but they can never compare to their father ” said BMW.

However, it will interest you to know that the big numbers show host actually prefers to follow the small numbers people on social media. He tweeted, “I have followers that I love,who are faithful,kind,mischievous,intelligent, witty & enterprising.But you see the people that I follow,the ones that have only between 10 and 2,000 followers?Those ones are the ones that are loyal & ready to bleed for me! I don’t joke with them.”
