One of the founding fathers of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Tom Ikimi, has declared his support for Governor Godwin Obaseki.
Tom Ikimi, an influential politician and former minister of foreign affairs, on Thursday urged the people of Edo state to reelect Obaseki for a second term when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held a campaign in his domain – Igueben local government area.
He charged eligible voters in the locality to key into the vision of the administration in order to take full control of what he called “the Esan Agenda,” noting that it can only be realised if the people are united and speak with one voice.
His words: “Esan people are now united. We have what we call ‘the Esan Agenda’. We can only realise the agenda if we support Governor Godwin Obaseki for a second term. We are supporters of Governor Godwin Obaseki. We believe in him,” he added.
The chairman of the Edo state PDP campaign council, Chief Dan Orbih, has said the September 19 gubernatorial election in the state would determine if democracy would survive in Nigeria.
Orbih made the submission while addressing PDP supporters at Ward 1, Ewohimi in Esan south-east local government area of Edo state.
His words: “This election will determine if we are prepared to practice true democracy in Nigeria. I am appealing to the presidency to ensure that this election is free and fair. Democracy is for the people, and our party, the PDP, has always been saying that power belongs to the people. Our priority is to return power back to the people in the coming election.”
Meanwhile, Governor Obaseki on Thursday took his reelection campaign to the Uromi Local Government Area of the state, with a promise to continue with his administration’s people-centric projects across the state.
The governor is accompanied by his deputy and running mate, Rt. Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu and other members of the Edo PDP campaign team.
