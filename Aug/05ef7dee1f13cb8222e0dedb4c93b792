Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu has announced that Ter Stegen, Semedo, Messi, De Jong, Lenglet, Dembélé and Griezmann will not be sold this summer. The rest of the squad are up for sale.

Barcelona after facing an embarrassing champions league exit against Bayern Munich last week are still finding it hard to get off the truama, as both the fans and players weren’t happy with the outcome of the game.

The catalan giants performances was very bad that they were defeated 8-2 by the Bavarians during the week, the highest number of goals they’ve ever conceded in any champions league match.

However, after the match series of news has been circulating round the world including Barcelona sacking their coach Quique setien, Messi planning to leave the club, many first team players put up for sale and the appointment of Ronald koeman as the new coach has all been moving round the media.

So who are the players Barca are hoping to do the job gor next season?

After the team rested on Sunday, on Monday seven players worked out at the ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper. And that seem to be the new plan.

The preparatory session took place on pitch 3, Rafinha, moussa wague, Oriol Busquets, Miranda all trained in the first, while new signings Fransisco Trincão, Pedri and Matheus Fernandes trained in the second.

Fransisco Trincão was signed by Barcelona from sporting Braga on January but was meant to stay with the Portuguese club until the end of the season, and after his stay he’s now in Barcelona.

Pedri is a Spanish player was playing for Las Palmas last season and his ability and talent got Barcelona’s interests.

Matheus Fernandes is a player signed from Brazilian league and is dubbed to succeed at the nou camp.
