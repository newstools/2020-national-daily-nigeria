The World Health Organisation (WHO) has insisted that it is unlikely that the Coronavirus can be transmitted through breastmilk, noting that it has not yet been detected in breastmilk.
WHO explained that breastmilk reduces infant mortality and provides numerous health advantages.
“Breastfeeding mothers can breastfeed their babies even if they are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19,’’ it said.
Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General of WHO, has also emphasised the importance of breastfeeding.
“WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed,” he noted.
Ghebreyesus said mothers should be counselled that the many benefits of breastfeeding for new-born babies and children outweigh the potential risks for COVID-19 infection.
