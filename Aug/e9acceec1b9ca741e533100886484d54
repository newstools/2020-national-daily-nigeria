Chelsea have now lured 18-year-old centre-back Xavier Mbuyamba following his departure from Barcelona this summer with the player penning a three-year contract in west London.
Mbuyamba spent the last year at Barca’s famous La Masia academy after departing Dutch club MVV Maastricht in 2019, playing as both a centre-back and a right-back for their Under-19 side while also training with the first team on occasions.
Yet despite putting pen to paper on a four-year deal at the Nou Camp, the Dutchman requested to leave this summer after being told he would only serve as back up in Barca’s B side next season.
The Catalans slapped a £1.8million price tag on Mbuyamba, but having asked him to accept a 50 per cent wage decrease amid the coronavirus pandemic it was decided he would instead be released.

The Blues were one of the first clubs to register an interest in Mbuyamba before Barca came calling, even inviting him to the club’s training complex to go through the gears with their youth teams.
However, they were unable to register him due to their FIFA-imposed transfer ban at the time.
Mbuyamba’s agent, Carlos Barros, told Voetbal International: “Chelsea gave a fantastic presentation. There is a unique football atmosphere there.
Barros has previously claimed that Real Madrid were also eyeing up a move for his client, while Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Celtic were also understood to be interested.
He would also be open to a loan move, with Vitesse Arnhem an option in his native Netherlands.
The former Barca academy star is composed on the ball and blessed with speed, but he will need to impress before being handed a first-team opportunity by Frank Lampard.
