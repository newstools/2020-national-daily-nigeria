A 10-year-old boy who has been chained in a goat shelter for two years in Kebbi state by his father and two stepmoms survived on goat feed and sometimes on his faeces before he was rescued on Monday.
The boy who was rescued by operatives of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), has been taken to the hospital for proper medical examination.
A statement by the Special Adviser on Media to the state governor, Aliyu Bandado, said the government delegation comprised chairman of Birnin-Kebbi Local Government, Permanent Secretary, Ministry for Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Aishatu Mai Kurata, Special Adviser, Women Affairs Hajia Zara’u Wali, and Senior Special Assistant, Aishatu Ibrahim Magawata, visited the boy, guaranteeing his medical treatment, feeding and education.
Police have arrested his father and two stepmoms suspected to be behind the boy’s ordeal.
The 10-year-old lost his mother about two years ago and has since been living with the three suspects.
Police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar confirmed the incident, saying, “We are aware of the matter, and the boy’s parents are with us while investigation is ongoing”.
