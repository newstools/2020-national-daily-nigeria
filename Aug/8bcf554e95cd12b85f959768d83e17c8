Share this on WhatsAppThe Aare Ona Kakanfo-in-Council headed by Iba Gani Adams has lashed out at President Muhammadu Buhari for his failure to secure Nigeria, especially as terrorists and violent Fulani herders fan out across the southwest.
In a communiqué after its meeting on Wednesday, the body advised governors in the region to direct Yorubas to obtain license to bear firearms.
The call was based on intelligence the council claims it has on the infiltration of ISIS terrorists to the southwest—a region many had initially believed was fortified and security-conscious.
It seems the terrorists have eventually found a way around the invincibility.
In a statement Babajide Tanimowo (the Atoloye Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland) signed after the meeting, the council said it received credible intelligence on how suspected ISIS operatives have positioned within the Oke-ogun corridor of Oyo.
“The intel also revealed that about 500 power bikes and assorted armour belonging to the terrorists have been physically sighted along the abandoned Lusada route moving towards Sokoto, from Igbo-ora in Oyo State,” it read in part.
The Council therefore urged all the governors in the southwest—and those of the north-central, including Kwara, Kogi—to direct their citizens to get licence to bear arms.
Benue Gov. Samuel Ortom made the call first weeks ago in his speech on security. He urged the federal government to authorize responsible citizens to carry AK-47.
