Banks branches on the Island, including those in Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki environs have expressed their decision to close early as from Monday, 24 August 2020 due to the partial closure of the Third Mainland Bridge by the federal government for impact assessment.
One of the banks, Fidelity Bank, in a statement on Thursday said following an impact assessment of the Third Mainland Bridge closure by the Lagos State Government (LASG) to commuters, all its branches within the Lagos Island, Ikoyi, Victoria Island, and Lekki axis of Lagos State will close to customers by 3 PM commencing Monday, 24 August 2020.
According to the bank, the measure was taken to reduce the time spent on the road as a result of the ongoing repairs.
“Please note that our Lagos Mainland branches, as well as our upcountry locations, will continue to operate the normal business hours of 8 AM to 4 PM. As always, our digital channels will remain available for your use 24/7.”
Recall that the Lagos State government had assured road users in the state of minimal inconveniences following the partial close down of the third mainland bridge for 6 months beginning from July 24, 2020.
This follows reports of some worn-out joints of the bridge which has raised some serious safety concerns for the users of the bridge. The Lagos State in collaboration with the Federal Government later announced the alternative routes mapped out for road users after repair works on some of them.
