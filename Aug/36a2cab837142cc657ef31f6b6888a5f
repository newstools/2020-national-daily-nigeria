Manchester City defeated former UEFA Champions League holders Real Madrid in a 4-2 aggregate to reach their first quarter finals.




The Citizens inflicted Zinedine Zidane’s first elimination from the Champions League, the French manager having won it three times in his three previous seasons in charge.
Meanwhile, it turned out to be an agonizing night for the Etihad club as they were handed a shocking 3-1 defeat by Olympique Lyonnaise to deny them the opportunity to match their 2016 semi-finals feat.
Kevin De Bruyne’s 69th minute goal for City could only cancel Maxwell Cornet’s 24th minute goal for Lyon. But Moussa Dembele’s 79th and 87th minute brace was enough to condemn Pep Guardiola and City to a shocking defeat and elimination from the long awaited UEFA Champions League glory.
Lyon who knocked out Juventus with away goal advantage after their 2-2 aggregate were seen by many as the underdogs especially when bringing the UEFA Champions League experience of Pep Guardiola into consideration.
The Ligue 1 side who have participated in UEFA Champions League 17 times, and during the 2009–10 season, reached the semi-finals of the competition for the first time after three previous quarter-final appearances will be seeking to pull up another shocker in their semi-finals encounter against Bayern Munich who thrashed Barcelona 8-2 to book their place in the semi-finals.
Guardiola and his City side can only return to England to prepare for a new campaign while hoping to up their game that will enable them capture their much desired Champions League glory.
