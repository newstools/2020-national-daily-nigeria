Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday sent a seeming controversial condolence letter to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State on the death of late Senator Buruji Kashamu who was declared dead of corona virus infection on Saturday.
The letter deserved no controversy since the former President was only counseling the living on the need to live righteous life towards living commendable virtue after death. The letter simply demonstrated that humans will always be remembered for the legacy they live behind on their departure from the world. Dr. Obasanjo, therefore, advocated the need to do what is right in one’s lifetime. Being an honest man, and someone that does not lie, Dr. Obasanjo in his condolence letter to Governor Abiodun did not hide what he knew about the late Buruji, cautioning of the lessons from the life and history of every departed human.
 
Obasanjo in the condolence letter wrote: “I received the sad news of the demise of Senator Esho Jinadu (Buruji Kashamu) a significant citizen of Ogun State.
 
“Please accept my condolence and that of my family on this irreparable loss.
 
“The life and history of the departed have lessons for those of all us on this side of the veil.
 
“Senator Esho Jinadu (Buruji Kashamu) in his lifetime used the maneuver of law and politics to escape from facing justice on alleged criminal offence in Nigeria and outside Nigeria.  But no legal, political, cultural, social, or even medical maneuver could stop the cold hand of death when the Creator of all of us decides that the time is up.
 
“May Allah forgive his sin and accept his soul into Aljanah, and may God grant his family and friends fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
The content shows that Dr. Obasanjo submitted to the supremacy of God, and the inevitable manifestation of divine justice of the Almighty. This, he said, man cannot manipulate.
The letter of condolence has been generating some disquiets.
