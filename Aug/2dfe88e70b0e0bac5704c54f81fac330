The Akwa Ibom State chapter of the Nigerian Union of Journalists has directed its members to boycott a planned media briefing by the travelling politician.
A journalist had sought to know why Fani-Kayode, who has no party title or official assignment, has embarked on touring the PDP state—and who is funding the gallivanting.
But FFK, who boasted of his short fuse and law profession, came down hard on the reporter, calling him stupid and small minded.
The Nigeria Union of Journalists lambasted Fani-Kayode, and directed all the state chapters across the nation to give him a media blackout.
“Akwa Ibom State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists has directed its members to boycott a press conference planned for Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister of aviation,” the statement read in part.
According to a statement signed by the Uyo chapter chairman, Emos Etuk, and Secretary, Dominic Akpan, the decision is in line with the instruction from the national leadership of the union.
Since his brief activity as campaign coordinator for the PDP in the 2015 presidential election, and the subsequent alleged complicity in Dasukigate, FFK has become a social media arrowhead of the PDP opposition.
It is not unlikely he will publicise himself on his Facebook page and Twitter handle without the help of the traditional media.
