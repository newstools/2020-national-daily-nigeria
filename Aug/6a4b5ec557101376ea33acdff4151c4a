Nollywood actress, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde has recounted her sad experience after she tested positive to coronavirus, adding that she also in the process infected her children with the deadly virus.
While reacting to the debate on how Nollywood can adhere strictly to the health guidelines of COVID-19, before reopening on the popular filmmakers’ WhatsApp group, Filmic, the 42-year-old actress, said she was treated by some infectious disease doctors who told her that many people are infected with the virus.
The actress further revealed that she infected her daughter and her asthmatic son with the disease but luckily her husband’s test came back negative.
“I hardly fell ill and so when I left the set and started having chills the next day or so, I knew something wasn’t right. I thought it might be stress. This was on Monday, August 3. I waited till Tuesday and it got worse. I was shaking uncontrollably and my temperature was going through the roof.
“My spirit told me immediately, this is not malaria or fever and I have been extremely careful and paranoid about this COVID-19 stuff. So I told hubby I needed to be tested immediately because I also have a son that has Asthma!
“They came to test me on Wednesday and my result came out on Thursday evening Positive. My world crashed. I felt crazy and empty. My symptoms were high fever and chills, luckily no other.
“I went into isolation immediately. We got my result but my daughter started feeling funny. So they had to come test the whole family. I had infected my daughter and asthmatic son!
“Fortunately, my God showed up for me as my son is asymptotic, so positive but not sick. However, my daughter lost her sense of smell and taste and had severe diarrhea but all has stopped now, thank God.”
