The incumbent Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has continued to fight back and counter every action of the assumed political godfather of Edo politics, Adams Oshiomhole, in the build up to the September 19 governorship election in the state. The governor frequently takes apt action to counter the poaching of political appointees in the state government to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), not giving space for any vacuum.
National Daily gathered  that the governor’s men in the Edo State House of Assembly, accordingly, impeached the Deputy Speaker of the State Assembly, Hon. Yekini Idiaye, on Wednesday following his defection from the PDP to the APC.
National Daily further gathered that Idiaye was impeached at the Plenary of the House on Wednesday in Benin City.
Hon. Roland Asoro, representing Orhionmwon II Constituency in the Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), was elected new Deputy Speaker.
Idiaye was impeached few days after he led four other lawmakers to defect to APC where they declared their support for the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
The lawmakers stated that they decamped from the PDP to return to the APC, the party platform they were elected to the House.
