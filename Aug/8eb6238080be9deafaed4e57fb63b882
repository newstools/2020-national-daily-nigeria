The Justice Ayo Salami panel has recommended sack of Ibrahim Magu, the suspended chairman of the EFCC, in its interim report it submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari days ago.
It also asked Buhari to prosecute Magu for corruption and abuse of office
The report stated Magu violated the Code of Conduct by not declaring all his asset when he assumed office in 2015.
Magu’s months-long began when AGF Abubakar Malami petitioned Bhari, alleging the EFCC boss was insubordinate and corrupt.
Magu has attempted to defend himself, but he was not given any opportunity as the panel invited petitions and witnesses from lawyers and suspect the commission is prosecuting.
The interim report recommended Buhari appoint a new head of the EFCC without delay.
Mohammed Umar, former Director of Operations at the EFCC, has been in charge of the commission in acting capacity since July 6 when Magu was detained.
Magu has been insisting he is innocent, and not even aware of why they are probing him.
According to his lwyer, he is not given fair hearing, same line many observers of the probe have given.
