As the political environment in Edo state gets more tensed, a former aide to Adams Oshiomhole has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Andrew Momodu, who dumped the ruling party is reported to have also donated N5m to the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki.

Reports say he made the promise during PDP governorship campaign rally in Ward 8, Anwain, Etsako West Local Government Area of the state on Tuesday.

He made the pledge on behalf of Anwain Progressives Union (APU), the umbrella Union of Anwain Clan after hundreds of APC members in the area defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the event.

Momodu assured Governor Obaseki that 6,000 votes from the ward would be cast for the PDP in the forthcoming poll to appreciate him for attracting development to the area, particularly the ongoing Agbede-Anwain road construction.

He said: “The Anwain Progressives Union, the umbrella union of Anwain Clan, has resolved to support Governor Obaseki with N5 million for his campaign. “We have collected our PVCs and have all resolved to give the governor 100 per cent of our votes come September 19, 2020. We are sure of giving you 6,000 votes from this ward.”

Addressing the PDP members and supporters in Anwain and Idegun communities, Governor Obaseki promised to reciprocate the kindness shown him by prioritising healthcare, education and agriculture, among others in the second term of his administration if re-elected.

“Since I started this campaign, this is the only place where indigenes are donating money to support my campaign. I am very grateful,” he said.
