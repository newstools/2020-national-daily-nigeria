Recall that the federal government had last week directed Wale Babalakin, pro-chancellor and chairman, governing council of the University of Lagos, to recuse himself from official duties relating to the institution following the crisis.
The embattled suspended V.C, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe was also directed to recuse himself as vice-chancellor, adding that a panel has been set up to probe the crisis rocking UNILAG.
The governing council had removed Ogundipe over alleged financial misappropriation and abuse of office.
But Ogundipe kicked against his removal, saying due process was not followed. He had filed a lawsuit at the national industrial court to challenge his removal.
But on Friday, Ogundipe withdrew the suit which had as defendants: UNILAG, Babalakin, UNILAG senate; Oladejo Azeez, the institution’s registrar; and Theophilus Soyombo, the acting VC.
