An Ile-Tuntun Customary Court in Ibadan, Oyo state, has adjourned a marriage dissolution case brought by one Gbade Olaniyi against his wife, Olubunmi until August. 19 for judgment.
Olaniyi, an electronics dealer claimed that his wife constantly beat him up on any simple argument
Testifying, Olaniyi, said: “my wife has emasculated me. She has sent my friends and family away.
“Anytime we have a minor misunderstanding, she gives me dirty slaps. In fact, she slapped me on Sunday Aug. 2, 10 days ago and tore my skin with her fingernails.
“She said she did it because I did not tell her where I went when she asked me. She has neglected her role as a wife because she leaves home for days and even months for no reason,” he said.
Olubunmi consented to the divorce prayer.
“My lord, my husband has turned me into pauper. Our children don’t even have good clothes to wear. I sometimes leave the home because he never took care of me during pregnancy.
“I slapped him because he sleeps with a certain young girl named Shukurat in our house and the secret leaked to me.
“I got to know when Shukurat’s aunt attacked him in my presence. I also have evidence of the love messages and credit cards sent by my husband to the girl and how they have been going to the hotel together,” Olubunmi explained.
Chief Henry Agbaje, the court’s President, held that the evidence provided by the two were not sufficient enough and therefore requested them to furnish the court with more.
