It was an exodus in Ondo West as more members of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and African Democratic Party (ADP) have defected to the APC on Wednesday.
The defection happened amidst high-power politicking that has seen Ondo’s Dep Gov Agboola Ajayi defect twice to the PDP and ZLP in his bid to contest the October guber election.
Analysts initially thought that Ajayi hopping into the ZLP, whose mainstay is the state’s former Gov Olusegun Mimiko, would still help his candidacy and grassroots fame puts up a good showing against APC’s candidate and Gov Rotimi Akeredolu and PDP’s Eyitayo Jegede.
But the turn of events since Ajayi’s defection has made things more volatile.
Among those that dumped the ZLP were Alhaji Basiru Oluwole, a former House of Assembly Candidate of ZLP, Hon. Ademulegun Adeala, Hon. Adesemoye Segun, a former ADC State Publicity Secretary, Legislative Aide to the member of House of Representatives, Ondo East /West, Hon. Alaba Oladele, Councillorship candidate of ADC in ward 5 Ondo West, Mrs Tessy Ibijoke Ajayi, among others.
Receiving the defector, Chairman of the Ondo APC, Ade Adetimehin, said the state might soon become a one party state owing to the number of prominent politicians defecting from other political parties.
“With what I am seeing here today, it is very safe to predict that Ondo State is gradually moving closer to becoming a one-party state,” he said.
