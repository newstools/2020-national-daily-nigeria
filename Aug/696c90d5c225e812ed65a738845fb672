Chairman of the Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council, Chief Dan Orbih, on Saturday alleged that the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has already compiled the list of commissioners, some of whom are not indigenes of Edo State, for the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council at a press conference in Benin City on Saturday cautioned Tinubu that his brand of politics or leadership in the south-west is not acceptable to the people of Edo State, warning that Edo is not Lagos. He also said that Tinubu cannot put Edo State in his pocket as he pocketed Lagos State.
Dan Orbih accordingly, declared: “I want to state that Edo is not Lagos. We have been informed that he has since drawn up a list of Commissioners which has been handed over to the APC candidate, which is made up of people who are not even from Edo State, because that is his style.”
Orbih maintained: “The Midwestern Region was created in 1963, Tinubu cannot redraw the political tree of Edo State with Oshiomhole and their preferred candidate. Edo people should be allowed to decide their destiny.
“Tinubu has put the entire Lagos State in his pocket. The huge revenue that accrues to Lagos State goes to his pocket and by his whims, he decides how much is devoted to development or any other business of government. Edo is not Lagos.
“We are putting him on notice that such a thing cannot and will never work in Edo. We are independent people and would not be put in the pocket of one man. The Lagos godfather shall soon find out that, indeed, Edo is not Lagos and he cannot extend his banana republic to Edo State.”
Orbih further declared: “But let me make it clear that it is now obvious to Edo people that what is going on at the State House of Assembly is influenced by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He will be resisted vehemently. I repeat, Edo is not Lagos.”
