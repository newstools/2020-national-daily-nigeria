Share this on WhatsAppAfter spurting out allegations he later had to apologise for—about the southern insecurity and the federal government connivance—Obadiah Mailafia, a director at the Nigeria Institute of Policy and Strategy Studies, Kuru, Jos, has resigned his appointment.
His lawyer Yakubu Bawa confirmed this in Jos on Tuesday.
Bawa said the former Mailafia, CBN’s former deputy governor, resigned his appointment last week and the NIPSS accepted it.
Mailafia’s resignation followed his invitation by the DSS and the police after he spun the conspiracy theories on a popular radio station in Abuja.
The former presidential candidate later denied he meant any harm, and insisted he’s a fan of President Muhammdu Buhari.
