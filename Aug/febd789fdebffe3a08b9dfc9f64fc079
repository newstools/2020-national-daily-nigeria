A presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, has denied reports that he had joined the All Progressives Congress (APC). Moghalu belongs to no political party since he resigned from the party that he used the platform to contest the 2019 presidential election which he lost massively. Moghalu said the report is false, mischievous, and tendentious.
Moghalu in a statement declared: “My attention has been drawn to a new story published by Elombah News, an online medium, with the false and misleading headline “Kingsley Moghalu has Joined APC – Anambra Spokesman”
“This headline, and the claim on which the report is based, is false, mischievous, and tendentious.
“In late 2019 I resigned my membership of the Young Progressives Party, the party platform on which I was a presidential candidate in 2019, but I did not subsequently join, and have not joined, any other political party.
“I am therefore NOT a member of ANY political party in Nigeria today.
“The article by Elombah News is doubly mischievous because, despite my denying this false claim when the online news outlet contacted me, Elombah News nevertheless went ahead to publish the story with this mischievous and misleading headline with no evidence to back it up, while burying my comment debunking the false claim deep inside its story. This is irresponsible journalism.
“I ask the public to disregard this fake news report, and to be guided by this clarification.”
