This was disclosed on Tuesday in Jos  by the Chairman coordinating Plateau, Hon. Rufus Bature.

It would be recalled that the Minister of State Labour and Employment, Bar. Festus Keyamo, had inaugurated a 20 man committee for selecting the unemployed in each State.

Keyamo had said that the program which was approved by President Buhari, is aimed principally to recruit 1000 itinerant unskilled workers in all the 774 local government areas in the in Nigeria.

However Bature said the decision to employ the unemployed was reached at by an inter-ministerial committee at the National level headed by the Director General of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE).

According to him: “My committee is saddled the responsibility of identifying and recruiting those to be engaged under the programme. The committee is to among other things saddled with the responsibility of identifying public works to be executed in each of the 17 LGA’s.

“This would be in addition to projects already identified by the Federal Ministries Agencies and Parastatals in different localities across the State”, Bature said.
