Mamman Daura
        
 


President Muhammadu Buhari has again violated the Covid-19 protocol by allowing a private jet fly his nephew Mamman Daura to the UK for urgent medical attention on Wednesday.
Nigeria has yet to approve re-opening of international flights since March.
But Daura’s case—he was allegedly showing symptoms of covid-19—made the Buhari-government defy the order.
Daura, one of the most powerful of the Aso Rock cabal, is 79.
In the early days of the pandemic lockdown, Buhari’s CoS Abba Kyari also fell sick, showing similar symptoms. 
The presidency, however, could not fly him to his hospital in the UK because of the ban on international flight by the UK.
