As the campaign for the September election in Edo hots up, the citizens are not the only one in conflict as far as voting goes; some of the traditional rulers are battling each other for their candidates, too.
The Ojirua of Irrua, HRH Williams Okuagban Momodu II, just endorsed the APC candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and he did so in a manner that could provoke other Edo rural chiefs who support the PDP candidate Godwin Obaseki.
Earlier in the day, the National Daily reported how the Enojie of Igueben, His Royal Highness, Ehizojie Eluojierior II, disgraced  Ize-Iyamu and his main backer Adams Oshiomhole who visited the palace.
As though it were a competition, the Ojirua made his own endorsement of the APC candidate with a lot of airs.
“I am the owner of Esan land,; he said when the APC campaign train visited him. “I will be celebrating 50 years on the throne next June, I am sure this Governor, Pastor Ize-Iyamu, is going to be my chairman.”
Calling him my governor, the traditional ruler added “your visit here is to further familiarize yourself with our people and have already been chosen.
Then he condemned the melodrama the Obaseki camp allegedly staged on the state assembly grounds last Thursday, when the governor apparently supervised the dismantling of the chamber rood and symbolic mace under the guise of renovation.
Many political analysts are already predicting the guber election in Edo will witness a lot more drama as it becomes increasing difficult for many of the stakeholders to maintain neutrality.
