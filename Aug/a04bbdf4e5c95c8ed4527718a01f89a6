A WAEC candidate who tested positive for COVID-19 a day to start his exam in Gombe is not giving up yet because the state Public Health Emergency Centre has not given up on him.
“COVID-19 cannot stop our positive student from writing the practical Chemistry today,” the centre tweeted on Tuesday.
According to the centre, the candidate, from Gombe Senior Secodary School, Gombe, wrote his second paper, chemistry, under close monitoring from an isolation centre to the school lab on Tuesday.
He wrote his first examination, Mathematics, from his isolation centre on Monday.
In the latest message posted on Tuesday, the centre said the candidate was transported to his school under Infection Prevention and Control.
“The invigilator was counselled and given Personal Protective Equipment and the laboratory was decontaminated afterwards.”
Attached to the message are photographs of the candidate where he was writing his examination and where he posed with others with the ambulance in the background among others.
On Monday, the centre tweeted the development, saying health and education are a priority in Gombe State.
“A final year student of GSSS Gombe tested positive for COVID-19 and was isolated yesterday (Sunday), today (Monday), he is writing Mathematics SSCE while ensuring his invigilator is well protected.”
