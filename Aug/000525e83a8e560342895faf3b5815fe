The Dutse branch of the Nigerian Bar Association in Jigawa  has asked the National Executive Committee of the NBA to re-invite Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, or risk its participation in the conference on Aug 24.
According to them, there is no difference between el-Rufai and Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike the NBA also invites. That is as far as allegations of rights abuse go.
“If complaints are to be judged on their face value and without due process, similar treatment is to (be) given to the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, who has serious allegations of abuse of human rights against him to the extent of demolition (of) residential houses and place of worship without observing due process,’ a statement by the Dutse branch said on Friday.
“A section of the country cannot, therefore, take us for a ride as we all have a fair understanding of the law.”
El-Rufai’s participation and keynote address have been subjects of rising petitions since Usoro announce the invitation.
The petitioners say the governor has failed in addressing insecurity in southern Kaduna.
