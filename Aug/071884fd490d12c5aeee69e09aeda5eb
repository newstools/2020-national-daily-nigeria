There’s been quite an uneasy and unsettled kind of relationship between United Arab Emirates (Dubai) and Nigeria lately since the arrest of a Nigerian social media personality, Hushpuppi. Many felt this might be the reason for the new rules the Dubai Government has given for all Nigerians and these rules are provided below:

First is that, Visa renewal for Nigerians in United Arab Emirates has been stopped.

Secondly, the Dubai Government noted that, Permanent residents returning approvals for Nigerians stopped.

Thirdly, Tourists visas for Nigerians on hold.

The fourth rule is that, all previously issued Visas are invalid.

Lastly on the rules released by the Dubai government is that, All visas for those presently in Dubai expires next week.

There’s been several reactions trailing this rules but, I think, what the Dubai Government meant is that, we should also stay in our country and develop it. Or is there anything contrary to this thought of mine you’d want to air? Do so in the comment section.
