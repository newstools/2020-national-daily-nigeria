The national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Friday condoled the families, relations, and friends of the victims who died in the helicopter crash in Lagos. The helicopter was identified to belong to Quorum Aviation.
The helicopter crashed on Friday afternoon into a building in Opebi, a suburb of Ikeja, Lagos State. An aviation authority was reported to have seen the Blackbox and commenced investigation into the crash.
