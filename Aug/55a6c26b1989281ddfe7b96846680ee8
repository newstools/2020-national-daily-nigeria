Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has debunked the speculations going round that he defected to All Progressives Congress (APC) because he was promised a joint ticket with the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu comes 2023.
In a statement on Sunday by his spokesman, Dogara accused some officials of the Bauchi state government of peddling the misinformation to discredit him and portray him as a desperate politician.
“These stories and pictures we understand are being sponsored by officials of the Bauchi State government in their desperate bid to lend credence to the infantile delusions of their principal, captured in his ludicrous postulations that Rt. Hon. Dogara left the PDP just because he was “deceived” by the APC with the promise of a position come 2023.”
The statement said Bauchi state Governor, Bala Mohammed “had publicly alluded to this and has continued to push these narratives all in an effort to malign and disparage the person of Rt. Hon. Dogara and divert attention of the people from issues of poor governance in the state.”
It said 2023 is still years away, “and therefore, it is unnecessary, distracting and insensitive to start making unfounded declarations at this time when all hands ought to be on deck in tackling the challenges of our nationhood.”
“To our best knowledge, no political party sells nomination and expression of interest forms for the post of a running mate as he/she is only appointed or selected by a flag bearer. It is therefore preposterous for anyone to claim that someone is running for the position of VP when no flag-bearer has emerged.”
Dogara said he is busy helping to rebuild and reposition the APC in Bauchi State and wishes to be allowed to focus on just that.
