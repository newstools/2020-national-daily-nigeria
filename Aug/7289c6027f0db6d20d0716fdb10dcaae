Two young boys were said to have been burnt alive on Saturday afternoon in Komarock Estate. The news was reposted on Femi Fani-Kayode’s social media with a caption that goes thus, “how can a nation, a continent and a people that indulge in this type of wickedness ever escape God’s wrath? You burn two children alive simply because they stole a mobile phone? God have mercy on you and all those that support and encourage this savagery and barbarity. Jungle justice is NO justice: it is madness”.

Reports didn’t include the nation where it happened but judging from the names of the people in the post, many suggest it was in Kenya.

The two young boys who were set ablaze on Saturday afternoon and toasted alive were allegedly caught stealing mobile phones from a member of the public.

It was said that the two boys was nabbed by angry boda boda riders who caught up with them just minutes after they stole a phone from a woman.

Peter Kimani, a shopkeeper and an area resident, said that cases of mobile phone thefts have been on the rise in the estate.

“The boys had just stolen the phone from a lady and were running away when they were nabbed, beaten and then set ablaze alive,” he said.

Another area resident, Mr Alan Kariuki said that the charged crowd even took some parts of a motorbike and used them to light the fire that ended the lives of the two boys.
“They removed part of the motorcycle, bought petrol and used it to end the lives of the two young boys,” he said.

Buruburu police boss Adamson Bungei asked the youth not to involve themselves in crime but also condemned incidents of mob justice.

“It is time the youth stop involving in crime since the fruits are so bitter. But members of the public should also not take action into their own hands,” he said.
