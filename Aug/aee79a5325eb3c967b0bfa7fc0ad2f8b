President Muhammadu Buhari met with Adams Oshiomhole at Aso Rock on Monday, and the outcome of the meeting could be a little upsetting for the APC former nation chairman.
Some disgruntled APC members, including the Progrssive Governors Forum D-G Salihu Lukman, have accused Oshiomhole of hijacking the APC campaign for its candidate Osagie Iz- Iyamu.
Buhari may have joined the detractors.
He warned Oshiomhole in the Monday meeting yesterday—to let peace reign in the Edo election.
“I briefed him on what is happening. You know his attitude is always clear about the Nigerian electorate, that their rights must always be respected,” Oshiomhole explained after the meeting.
It might be okay of Buhari to warn his party man to respect the Edo electorate, but Oshiomhole, who brought back Ize-Iyamu to whip Gov Godwin Obaseki, is not the only one protecting his interest by all means in the state.
Obaseki, too, is not going to accept being kicked out of the APC and the government house in one fell swoop.
The governor has exerted his immunity as far as interfering in the state assembly, and pulling down the legislative chamber to frustrate the pro-Oshiomhole majority lawmakers in the state.
But Buhari won’t be dragged into the state’s election affair no matter how violent things go.
Which probably explains why he swayed to the side of Lukman and others who believe Oshiomhole should take the blame for all the upheavals in Edo.
