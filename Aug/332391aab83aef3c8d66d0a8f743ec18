Several youths and women in Edo State on Friday took to the streets of the state capital, Benin City, to challenge the acts of impunity and lawlessness by the Edo State All Progressives Congress (APC). The youths and women cautioned APC against anti-democratic acts and threat to peace in the state.
National Daily gathered that the youths and women were joined by supporters of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in their protest at the Edo State House of Assembly which was taken over by the Police of Thursday as the state was thrown into political turmoil. The Police and other security operatives were said to be at the Assembly to protect the facility.
The protesting Edo youths and women expressed their solidarity and support for Governor Godwin Obaseki. They were said to have prayed for the restoration of peace in the state.
The protesting youths and women also declared their support for the Speaker of the Edo House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Frank Okiye. They affirmed their recognition of Okiye as the Presiding Officer of the State House of Assembly in Edo.
The angry youths expressed their opposition  to the illegal Speaker of the House, Victor Edoror, who was said to be sworn in by 17 APC lawmakers on Thursday, 14 of whom were identified not to be official members of the Edo State House of Assembly. The protesters, accordingly, rejected the inauguration of the 14 lawmakers-elect in Edo at a private residence in Benin City. The protesters argued that the inauguration of the legislators violated the law, insisting that the lawmakers have lost their seats after they failed to participate in legislative proceedings for a period prescribed by the law upon which their seats were declared vacant.
