The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised alarm that the ousted national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, allegedly disbursed over N500 million to recruit thugs for the invasion of the Edo State House of Assembly, as well as some lawmakers to further cause mayhem in the state legislature.
The PDP in a statement by the Edo State Publicity Secretary, Chris Osa Nehikhare, urged the people of the state to rise against the impunity of the APC and attempt to subvert the licit government of the state. The PDP also accused Oshiomhole of leading thugs to the House of Assembly on Thursday morning.
The State Publicity Secretary, Nehikhare, had declared in the statement: “It has come to our knowledge that the APC led by Adams Oshiomhole will this morning, Thursday, August 6, 2020, lead thugs to the premises of the State House of Assembly in an attempt to illegally take over the House, the legislative arm of government.
“He has over the last few weeks disbursed over N500 million to entice and purchase members of the House for his illegal take-over attempt in a gestapo style operation.
“All Edo persons of goodwill should reject this brazen attack on our democracy and resist it.
“We, hereby, call on all Edo people to march to the House of Assembly complex in Kings Square in support of democracy and against this impunity.
“We cannot continue in this way!
“Edo must be Reset!!”
