A Non-governmental Organisation under the aegis of Global Centre For Media And Human Empowerment, has rated the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development low, calling the federal government to investigate the Ministry.

The NGO headed by its Acting Director General, Charles Ejoh, said the Minister, Hajiya Sadiya Farouk, should be handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, for failure to give a comprehensive account of how it spent billions of naira on its intervention on the distribution of palliatives and support to victims of terrorists attacks in Nigeria.

“We want President Muhammadu Buhari led APC government to beam its search light on the Ministry headed by Sadiya Farouq, as we are all aware of how the leadership of the National Assembly recently raised alarm on the failure of the interventionist Ministry”.

Ejoh said Nigerians has watched with dismay the operation of the Ministry over time in providing humanitarian assistance and have been seriously indicted on the integrity, competence and fairness of the Ministry’s programmes.

“The distribution mode has been questionable. The spread of the distribution has been tailored in favour of some certain section of the country and hardly could any poor or displaced persons supposedly benefitted be clearly identified.

“The operations of the scheme smacks of gross nepotism and a lot of what is going on in the Ministry activities smells of corruption that should not be swept under the carpet”.

The NGO however appeal to Buhari to split the Ministry into two separate entities for easy management, as a vote of no confidence is passed on Farouq for her clueless style of running the Ministry.
