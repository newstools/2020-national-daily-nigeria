She told the Police the sexual affairs with the father have affected her private part, making it difficult to control her urinary system.
The girl also told the police she lost her mother when she was barely two and the father did not allow her to know her maternal relations, explaining she was left with the option than to live with him.
She told the Police the unfortunate situation gave the father an unhindered opportunity to sexually abuse her routinely until her incontinence condition developed and had to report him to the Police.
His ex-wife informed the police she caught him while in the act, explaining it was why she walked out of the union.
