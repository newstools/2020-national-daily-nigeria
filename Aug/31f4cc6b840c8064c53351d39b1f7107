Tanko Yakassai, who was a liaison officer to former President Shehu Shagari, said if Nigerians give Tinubu the opportunity to be president, he will perform better than Buhari.
Yakassai’s admiration for Tinubu’s suitability and strategic planning grew out of his recent visit to Lagos.
Speaking in an interview in Kano, Yakassai said Tinubu is better at planning than Buhari and stressed that planning is what makes a better leader.
“If you are talking of making a better president, to be honest with you, I think if Tinubu can get the APC ticket and is elected, he will perform better than Buhari. I do not doubt in my mind,” said Yakassai in an interview with the Dail Times.
“Go to Lagos and see what Tinubu did, when I went for an occasion, I took my time on the day of my arrival to go and have a look at Lekki.”
He insisted that what makes a better political leader in government is the plan.
“If you have a plan, you can do it; without a plan, you cannot perform.”
Tinubu has yet to out with hi strategy for the 2024 presidency. But many reading his body language belie he’s eyeing Nigeria’s top job, and he may give it a shot come 2023.
The former Lagos governor has been the only presidential wannabe from the south who has been coming up frequently as the only one made of presidential stuff—among the lot preparing for the presidency in 2023.
