Chinonye Obiagwu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said the government Malami works has no respect for court orders, either.
“I will have gone further to disinvite people like the Attorney General of the Federation because we have on record more than 50 orders of the court that have been disobeyed by this government,’ he said during a show on Channels TV on Sunday.
“And how will you get the Attorney General of that nation to come to NBA conference; the Attorney-General that says national security takes precedence over the rule of law and human rights.”
The NBA disinvited Kaduna Gov. Nasir el-Rufai for his penchant for disobeying court orders, and inability to bring to justices criminals perpetrating the southern Kaduna killing.
The decision has split the pressure group along religious and ethnic lines as braches from Jigawa, Kaduna, Bauchi, and others have threatened to boycott the conference if the same rule applied to el-Rufai doesn’t apply to other speakers.
Former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Rivers Gov.  Nyesom Wike are two other speakers the angry lawyers seek to dis-invite.
