Juventus is having a shake up. And it appears it’s not just Sarri that is leaving the helm of affairs. The heavy weight attacker bought from Real Madrid two years ago, Cristiano Ronaldo, is about to be the next in line.

Juve have appointed Pirlo as their new manager. They now would also like to have new set of attackers. While at that they have shown interest in tightening their defence with a solid DM — Thomas Partey.

However, the biggest news is the agreement with Ronaldo to join Barcelona. News already have it that Juve has offered Ronaldo to Barcelona in a bid to reduce their heavy wage billl.

With the Serie A champions hit hard financially by the Covid-19 pandemic, the club is looking to get rid of Ronaldo’s mammoth contract and have contacted Barcelona about their interest, according to Spanish journalist Guillem Balague.

Ronaldo was Juve’s top scorer during the recent season with 35 goals in all competitions. The world has always wondered what it will be for these two icons to play in a team. This may be the opportunity. Given the fact that Barca is also looking to refresh it’s team’s depth and the current statement from PSG president that says Neymar and Mbappe will never leave PSG.

Barca may as well turn their interest to Ronaldo who definitely must have agreed to go to Barcelona. Otherwise, Juve’s board wont be making the offer.
