For whatever reason, Femi-Fani Kayode, a untitled PDP member without any political structure, believes he has clout in the party, so he butts in any time there’s leadership crisis, and, this time, he’s threatening the party’s NWC.
“No-one, no matter how big or powerful, should think that they own the PDP,” he said in a Facebook post August 12.
According to him, it is wrong for the party NWC to take the party structures away from Cross Rivers Governor Ben Ayade who is having crisis in his state.
The Uche Secondus-led NWC waded into the succession crisis rocking the party in Cross Rivers by setting up a caretaker committee.
The arrangement is expected to bring to heel the Ayade’s faction rooting for one of their own for 2023, and the Abuja faction trying to bring in one of them.
But Fani-kayode describes the NWC decision as nonsense.
“It would be a big mistake for the National Working Committee of the PDP to take the party structures in his state away from Ben Ayade, the Governor of Cross Rivers state, and hand them over to anyone else,” he said.
“If this is done and Ayade leaves the party be rest assured that many of us will leave with him.
“You cannot and must not undermine a sitting Governor or attempt to humiliate him in his own state and before his people.”
Fani-Kayode has done his round across the two major parties in Nigeria. In 2014, he left the APC for the PDP, where he was before. It’s really no news if political blowhards like him jump ship again.
He noted that some of the governors are advocating emasculation of Ayade  would never allow it to happen in their own states. A word is enough for the wise.
