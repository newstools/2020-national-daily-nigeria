At least 42 of the appointees in Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki have ratted on him in the last few weeks, and 17 of the 24 state legislators have pledged allegiance to the APC candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu, making the governor the most deserted in his ongoing administration.
According Deputy Speaker, Edo House of Assembly (EDHA), Yekini Idiaye, from Akoko Edo Constituency 1, who just pledged his support for Ize-Iyamu, there;s no point following Obaseki to the PDP.
Similarly, Emmanuel Agbage (Akoko-Edo Constituency 2); Nosayaba Okunbor (Orhionmwon East Constituency); Dumez Ugiagbe, member-elect (Ovia North East Constituency 1); and Mr Vincent Uwadiae, member-elect (Ovia North East Constituency 2) also pledged their support for the Edo APC candidate.
Speaking during a solidarity visit to Ize-Iyamu in Benin on Monday, the members of EDHA said they would not defect from APC to another party and had endorsed Ize-Iyamu as their governorship candidate.
The deputy speaker said he was elected under the APC platform and was ready to work for the party to emerge victorious in the governorship election.
“I am from Shomorika in Akoko Edo Local Government Area (LGA) and my village is the most backward in Akoko Edo,” he said.
Agbaje called the four years of Obaseki wasted, saying he is ready to go to the next level with Pastor Ize-Iyamu.
“There are clear reasons why we are standing for our party, because what would have been our problem in making progress has left us.
“I want to assure Edo people that with the emergence of Ize-Iyamu, Edo will move forward,” he said.
