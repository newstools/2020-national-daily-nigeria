Mamman Daura
        
 












There appears to be renewed tension in the Nigerian presidency on Wednesday as one of the notable personalities in the Presidential Villa, Mamman Daura, was reported to have been flown to London, the United Kingdom (UK) in a private jet for urgent medical attention. Though the ailment for which Daura was reportedly taken to London with urgency was not disclosed; there was fear that he was showing symptoms ‘related’ to Coronavirus infection from last Friday.
It was gathered that Daura, a former journalist, widely perceived as a member of the ‘Cabal’, around President Buhari, was said to have had a history of renal crisis and had regularly visited the West for medical attention.

Meanwhile, it is anticipated that stakeholders of goodwill in the Nigerian project can only pray for the wellbeing of Mamman Daura.  The Presidency recently mourned eath of a close companion, Isa Funtua; while the exit of late Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, was about getting out of memory.
