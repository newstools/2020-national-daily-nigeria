Nigeria controversial music sensation, Azeez Fashola aka Naira Marley was on Friday convicted by Abuja Mobile Court.
Reports from NAN reveal that Naira Marley was charged with four counts.
According to the judgment, the musician violated series of the lockdown instructions ranging from interstate travel ban, non-use of face mask, breaking of social distancing order and attending a concert despite COVID-19 restriction order.
Naira Marley was fined N200,000.
The Magistrate, Idayat Akanni, set the fine after the musician pleaded guilty.
However, his counsel, Mohammed Yunusa, said his client was made to believe that the organisers of the concert had procured all the approval from the government.
In addition to the fine, Naira Marley was mandated to publish a public apology to the Federal Government in a national daily as revealed by the Chief State Counsel, Udeme Umana.
“This will serve as a deterrent to other Nigerians”, Umana stated.
The concert was held at the Jabi Lake Mall on June 13.
It was organized by Play Network Africa, Traffic Bar, El’Carnival, and sponsored by Glenfiddich.
Following public outrage, the FCT Administration shut down the mall.
Recall that the operation of ExecuJet airline that flew Naira Marley and others to Abuja from Lagos was suspended by the Federal Government.
The ban was, however, lifted late July.
