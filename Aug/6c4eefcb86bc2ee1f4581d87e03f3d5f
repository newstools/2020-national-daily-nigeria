Fulani militias have been identified to be the most dreaded terror group in Nigeria. A study report highlighted that Fulani militias in three years slaughtered over 2,539 persons, injured 393, kidnapped 253 people, raped 16 victims, burnt 7, 582 houses and destroyed 24 churches. They were also disclosed to have struck in 654 attacks within three years.
National Daily gathered that the study was conducted by Dr. José Luis Bazán, an Independent Researcher and Analyst in Brussels, Belgium, with the title: “Fulani Militias Terror: Compilation of News (2017-2020)”.
The study identified major terror groups involved in wild and systematic violent attacks in Nigeria. These include the Boko Haram, the ISIL in alliance with Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP), the Fulani militias and Ansaru
The study indicated that the Global Terrorist Index 2019 published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, identified that the surge in terrorist uprising in Nigeria to be carried out not mainly by the Boko Haram, ISWAP or Ansaru, but the Fulani extremists, adding that this was the basic cause of the increase in terrorism in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The report further highlighted: “In 2018, Fulani extremists were responsible for the majority of terror-related deaths in Nigeria (1,158 fatalities), with an increase by 261 and 308 per cent, respectively, from the prior year.
“Most of Fulani attacks were armed assaults (200 out of 297 attacks) against civilians (84 per cent of the attacks). “Bandits and criminal gangs’ attacks are also part of the unfortunate reality that Nigerians have to face in their lives.”
The study further indicated: “Most of the victims are farmers – predominantly, Christians, but Fulani (predominantly, Muslim) have also attacked policemen, soldiers, etc.
“In some cases, media identify the religious denomination of the victims (for example, when the attacks took place during or after religious ceremonies), in particular Christian media, that have a better knowledge about the affiliation of their own faithful.”
The study was said to be solely conducted on the attacks in Nigeria linked “presumably” to Fulani by militia by the media, NGOs and, in few cases, private sources.
The study also indicated that listed attacks were detected through date of occurrence – or if not possible to date it precisely, date of the report; from 2017 to May 7, 2020.
According to the study, the breakdown of the attacks carried out by Fulani militias between 2017 and 2020 revealed that in “2017, 99 attacks took place, 202 people killed, more than 33 wounded, 12 kidnapped, four raped and 6,500 houses burnt.
“In 2018; 245 attacks took place, 1,478 killed, 230 wounded, 29 kidnaped, seven raped, 300 houses burnt.
“In 2019; 169 attacks took place, 524 killed, 84 wounded, 75 kidnapped, 606 houses burnt.
“In 2020 (January-May), 141 attacks took place, 335 killed, 137 kidnapped, two raped, 176 houses burnt.”
