The 13 Crew Members Of Product Tanker MT Curacao Trader, Who Were Kidnapped Off Benin Back In July, Have Been Released.
The information was confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier this week, saying that seven Russian sailors were released on August 24.
Sources said the remaining six Ukrainian sailors have also been freed.
The Ministry said the release resulted from joint efforts carried out by the Russian Embassy diplomats in Abuja, Nigeria and the representatives of the shipowner.
The crew members are currently located at the regional headquarters of the Nigerian Navy in Port Harcourt, where they will undergo medical examination before returning to their homelands.
on July 17, 2020, a group of armed pirates boarded the product tanker approximately 210 miles of the coast of Benin and kidnapped 13 crew members. Six unqualified seamen were left on board the drifting ship.
The ship was assisted by the crew of MV Frio Chikuma, which was sailing nearby, and helped navigate the ship to a safe port.
