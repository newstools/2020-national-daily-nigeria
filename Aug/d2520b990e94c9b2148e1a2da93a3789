Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, also known as Omosexy, in Nollywood, has tested positive for COVID-19.
The 42-year-old actress announced this on her Instagram handle Saturday, telling her fan she’s getting better though.
“I know most of you have been wondering where I’ve been,’ she wrote.
“Well, I contracted COVID. I have been ill, in Isolation and now getting better.”
Before now, the movies star had been posting the pictures of her hubby, a pilot, on social media, describing him as a hero for defying the initial commotion in the early days of the pandemic to go bring their children from the US.
Covid-19 has infected well over 45,000 Nigerians, killing about 1000 of them since its spread to Nigeria late February.
