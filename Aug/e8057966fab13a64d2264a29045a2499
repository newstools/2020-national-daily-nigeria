Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has insisted that the new Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) recently signed into law, is being targeted at Churches and other religious organisations.
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a tweet on his verified handle described the new law as the greatest threat to Christianity in the country.
He however said nothing can bring down the church as the it will continue to grow from strength to strength.
“Though the legislation known as CAMA represents the greatest threat to Christendom in our history, those behind it fail to appreciate that the gates of hell SHALL NOT prevail against the Church. No matter what they do, Jesus remains Lord and the gospel shall continue to flourish.”
Recall that the World Council of Bishops had emphatically described CAMA laws on churches, religious bodies by Nigeria’s Federal Government as an illegality.
President Buhari signed the CAMA act which has generated a lot of controversies, into law earlier this month.
The Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN), had also described it as satanic, demanding that the President halt the implementation of “the obnoxious and ungodly law until the religious institutions are exempted from it.”
Also, the founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, also known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, was one of the first religious leaders to warn the President Buhari government against the application of CAMA in churches.
