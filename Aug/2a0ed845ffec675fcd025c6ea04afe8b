An Abuja Mobile Court on Friday convicted Azeez Fashola aka Naira Marley.
Fasola was charged with four counts: violation of interstate travel ban, non-use of face mask, breaking of social distancing order and attending a concert despite COVID-19 restriction order.
The musician was then fined N200,000  by Magistrate Idayat Akanni, after the musician pleaded guilty.
His counsel, Mohammed Yunusa, said his client was made to believe that the organisers of the concert had procured all the approval from the government.
Chief State Counsel, Udeme Umana, revealed that the court mandated Naira Marley to publish a public apology to the federal government in a national daily.
“This will serve as a deterrent to other Nigerians”, Umana stated.
The concert, held at the Jabi Lake Mall on June 13, was organized by Play Network Africa, Traffic Bar, El’Carnival, and sponsored by Glenfiddich.
The airline and the mall owners were sanctioned earlier.
