Share this on WhatsAppOndo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu is fussing around as he expects a major leak by his deputy Ajayi Agboola who is said to be in possession of documents that confirm abuse of office by the governor.
Through one of his spokespersons, Akeredolu said the leak is part of the months-long plot to malign him, his family members, and his top officials.
But Agboola, in response, taunted the governor, saying no document or receipts can prove any more than what is in plain view.
“The fact that the family of Akeredolu is running the government is an open secret to everyone in Ondo state and don’t need any document, either clone or otherwise to prove that. Like lawyers say, ‘that fact speaks for itself’.
According the ZLP candidate in the forthcoming guber election, Akeredolu’s wife has about six projects she uses to siphon money.
“Their son is the consultant to the board of IGR and has access to N4b stashed in an account where he got ten percent of the money,” he said.
As deputy governor, how Agboola got to know all these and their dossiers may not be difficult to understand, especially as he fell apart with Akeredolu more than a year ago because he and the governor could not trust each other again.
The governor, however, said it’s all fake.
“Agboola engaged the services of two popular printers in Ondo town and Akure, the state capital, to print fake documents and clone receipts purported to have been presented by members of the governor’s immediate family and senior government officials for transactions.”
Countering that, Agboola insisted, “People don’t need document to show that the government of Akeredolu is the government of father, mother and son and in laws.”
