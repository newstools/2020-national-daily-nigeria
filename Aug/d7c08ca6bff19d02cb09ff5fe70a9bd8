Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday ignored the National Council of State meeting convened by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja. The Thursday National Council of State meeting presided by President Buhari was conducted both on personal physical attendance at the State House of through virtual participation.
Apparently, if Dr. Obasanjo had any challenge of physical appearance, he would have participated from whatever location he was at the time of the meeting.
However, the meeting was attended directly and through virtual participation by other former Nigerian leaders.
National Daily gathered that former President Goodluck Jonathan, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Minister of the FCT, Mohammed Bello; and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; were physically present at the State House.
Former heads of state, retired Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Abdusalam Abubakar; head of the interim national government, Ernest Shonekan, participated in the meeting through virtual interactions.
Former President Obasanjo did not also send any word on his absence from the meeting.
It will be recalled that President Buhari also boycotted virtually all National Council of State meetings presided by former President Obasanjo after he lost the 2003 presidential election to Obasanjo. The president sustained his absence from the National Council of State even during the late President Umar Musa Yar’Adua administration after he also lost 2007 presidential election to Yar’Adua.
The incumbent president resumed attendance of the National Council of State meeting in the later part of the former President Goodluck Jonathan administration when he was preparing for the presidential election and mobilizing support from former Nigerian leaders, including Obasanjo.
