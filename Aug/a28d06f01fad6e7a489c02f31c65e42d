The Akinyele Serial killer Sunday Shodipe, the prime suspect arrested in connection with the multiple killings in the Akinyele Local Government Area, murdered another woman two days after he escaped from police custody.
Oyo Commissioner of Police Nwachukwu Enwonwu, who paraded him alongside other suspects, said this on Wednesday.
The 19-year-old killer won’t be punished like other murderers.
“Upon interrogation, he explained that he managed to escape from custody when an Inspector attached to the Divisional Police Headquarters, Mokola gave him the permission to take his bath within the premises of the station.
“He also confessed that on August 13 at about 2:30pm, he attacked one Mrs Funmilayo Oladeji in her house at Onikeke community in Akinyele.
The suspect had killed no fewer than eight people in the LGA before he was arrested, and charged to court.
The CP said the suspect who was standing trial before his escape would be handed over to the correctional centre soon.
Murder is a capital offence in Nigeria, though.
According to him, the suspect was kept in police custody because the prisons could not take him for fear of Covid-19.
