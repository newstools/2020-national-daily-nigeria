As the Democratic National Convention starts, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Joe Biden maintains lead over President Donald Trump, up by 9 percentage points.
He leads in 11 combined battleground states – Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Biden is ahead in three Midwest states that voted for Trump in 2016 – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
However, in a CBS News poll of likely voters nationwide, the former vice president leads by 10 points.
Also, RealClearPolitics survey sees Biden leading by 7.9 points.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that 54 percent of voters endorsed his selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate.
In a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, Biden was hailed for his choice of Harris.
It showed that 50 percent of registered voters support the Biden-Harris ticket, while 46 percent back Trump and his deputy, Mike Pence.
In reaction to Harris’ emergence as VP candidate, the President had feasted on her comments on fracking, socialized medicine, military funding and tax increment.
Trump also recalled her attacks on Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
