As the Sept. 19 election draws close and the two major parties read the lips of power brokers and voters influencers, the APC just scored what it considered a huge point.
Its candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu was, finally, able to meet President Muhammadu Buhari at Aso Rock.
The meeting on Friday followed public outrage after a series of near-violent activities on the state assembly complex, clandestine meetings of lawmakers, and impeachment of Speakers and deputies.

Ize-Iyamu arrived Aso Rock but was initially unable to see Buhari. He was later taken to the president for presentation of the party flag.
Buhari was invited to attend the party rally on Saturday, but he declined.
Apparently, it was a big relief for the APC and its candidate who had been wondering if Buhari was going to give their campaign his blessing.
Buhari’s belated nod must have created a panic in the camp of the PDP and its candidate Gov. Godwin Obaseki who also believed the APC candidate was out of favour with the party leader.
