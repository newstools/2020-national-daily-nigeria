Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has pleaded with members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to forgive Engr. Segun Oni who returned to the party recently.
Fayose, who officially received Oni back to the party on Saturday also maintained that it was not an endorsement for the former All Progressives Congress, APC Deputy National Chairman (South) to run for the governorship election.
Oni, a onetime governor of Ekiti State from 2007 to 2010, recently returned to his former party, the PDP.
Fayose, in a statement, shared on Twitter, said, “To my brothers and sisters in the PDP Osoko Political Family, having formally received Engr Segun Oni into the PDP at yesterday’s State Congress, henceforth, nobody should castigate, embarrass or undermine him (Oni) on any social media platforms associated with Osoko Political Family.
“True leadership is demonstrated by forgiveness, followed by restoration after a show of true humility. However, this statement does not represent or amount to the endorsement of Engr Segun Oni’s gubernatorial ambition.
“Rather, it is part of our sincere efforts to keep the party together and accommodate everyone, except those members who are due for political perdition. Once again, I congratulate the State Chairman, Bisi Kolawole and other members of the State Exco. I wish them a successful tenure.”
