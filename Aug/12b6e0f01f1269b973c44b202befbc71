Weeks after he abandoned the All Progressives Congress [APC] for the Peoples Democratic Party [PDP] following disagreement with his principal, the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Hon Agboola Ajayi, has again exited the PDP.
Ajayi, it was gathered, left the party following his inability to clinch the governorship ticket, and has been offered the ticket of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), his new party.
He has been cleared by the National Executive Committee of the ZLP to contest the election.
Ajayi said he resigned from the PDP due to calls on him by a majority of the people of Ondo State to give hope to the hopeless, provide credible and purposeful leadership in the state.
Speaking through his Media Adviser, Allen Sowore, Ajayi asked his supporters to remain focused and committed, saying he would soon announce his next line of action.
He appreciated the National Leadership and members of the PDP for their warm reception and acceptance in the short period he rejoined the party.
Chairman of the PDP in Apoi Ward II of Ese-Odo Local Government Area, Festus Oboro acknowledged receipt of the resignation letter dated August 9, 2020.
Ajayi resigned from the APC and rejoined the PDP on June 21 2020.
