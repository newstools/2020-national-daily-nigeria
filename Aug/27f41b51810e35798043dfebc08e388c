Ronald Koeman has been appointed as the new Barcelona manager, taking over from Quique Setién who was appointed in January, 2020.
Quique Setien’s short-lived reign as Barcelona head coach is expected to come to an end on Monday after the Catalan giant held a board meeting.
The 61-year-old only took over from Ernesto Valverde in January but has presided over one of the worst periods in the club’s history.
After exiting the Copa del Rey early and finishing second to Real Madrid in La Liga, Barca suffered a humiliating 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the last eight of the Champions League.
The new coach, Koeman was a former Barcelona player, and assistant manager, and will leave his role as Netherlands coach to take over at the Camp Nou in time for the new season.
Setién’s days looked numbered even before the humiliating 8-2 defeat against Bayern Munich on Friday and he will leave after seven uncomfortable months.
Barcelona finished five points behind Real Madrid in the league and lost to Athletic Bilbao at the quarter-final stage in the Spanish Cup. It is the first time in the past 12 years that the club have ended a season trophyless.
Koeman had already turned Barça down in January, when the club were looking for a replacement for Ernesto Valverde, but this time he could not resist the challenge.
The original preference for the Barça president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, was to hire Mauricio Pochettino but some board members were against that considering the former Espanyol manager once said that he would rather go and work on a farm than manage Barcelona
