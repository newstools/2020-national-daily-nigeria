The Special Military Task Force otherwise known as Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), deployed to restore peace in Plateau State, on Tuesday said it has rearrested one of the inmates who escaped from a high court at Barkin-ladi Local Government Area of the State in July 2020.

The OPSH who spoke through its Commander, Maj. Gen. Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, said in a statement sent to our correspondent that the escapee was caught in an abandoned building in Bisichi district of Barkin-Ladi LGA, at about 3pm.

The recaptured prisoner identified as  Mallam Adam Yusuf, was among six others escaped in July of which one of them, Mohammed Ibrahim, was caught by the OPSH and with this latest arrest the total number of rearrested inmates is brought to two, Okonkwo said.

The rearrested criminal just like the first one we caught will be handed over to the Nigerian Correctional Service Plateau State Command for necessary action, the Army boss affirmed.

According to him: “The 19 years old inmate have confessed to be among the six escapees. It is pertinent to stress that concerted efforts are ongoing to rearrest the remaining. Information that may lead to the rearrest of the remaining inmates are therefore solicited from the members of the general public”, he said.
