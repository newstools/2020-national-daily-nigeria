Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Naa’ba, has been summoned by the Department of State Services (DSS) following the formation of a new anti-government group- National Consultation Front, whose aim is to enthrone a new Nigeria.
Recall that Naa’ba, at a conference at the weekend announced the coming together of people of like minds to form the new group following what he described as the deplorable state of the nation.
“Unfortunately, our over bloated political structure and warped governance system has not been able to rise to the situation at all thereby leaving the Nigerian people distraught, distressed and despondent. Clearly, this state of affairs in our country is unacceptable and unsustainable.
“Consequently, upon these tales of woes in our country, we, as a group of concerned citizens with great conscience are now compelled by these various threats to come forward and confront these threats by initiating an urgent political action for a new Nigeria where citizens can attain their needs and potential fulfilment.”
Naa’ba also stated that Nigeria has become a failed state where insurgency, banditry and kidnapping has become the order of the day due to the incompetence of the present leadership.
Announcing the invitation by the DSS, National Consultative Front spokesperson, Tanko Yunusa, said the former Speaker will honour the DSS invitation on Monday by 12:00pm.
He noted: “Please, be notified that the DSS on Friday sent an invitation to NCFront Co-Chair and former Speaker of Nigeria, Rt Hon Ghali Umar Na’abba, after his very profound interview on Channels Television on Thursday in regard to the NCFront agenda to bring about a new Nigeria that works for all.”
Yunusa called on all NCF organs, structures and allies nationwide to be on alert.
