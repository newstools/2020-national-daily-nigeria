Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar is reportedly at risk of being banned for the Champions League final by UEFA for breaking coronavirus rules during his club’s semi-final match against Leipzig.
After PSG prevailed with a 3-0 victory against RB Leipzig in Portugal, Neymar swapped shirts with Leipzig’s Marcel Halstenberg.
European football’s governing body introduced strict ‘return to play’ protocols for the Champions League and Europa League last month to ensure the two tournaments could be completed safely.
The 31-page document outlines extensive health and safety measures including regular testing, dedicated zones for players, staff and media within the stadiums and the wearing of face masks.
Also included in the protocols was advice on shirt-swapping, which stated that “players are recommended to refrain from swapping their shirts”.
The document does not explicitly state what the punishment would be for shirt swapping, though it does say that “non-compliance with the obligations set out in the UEFA Protocol may lead to disciplinary measures in accordance with the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations.”
PSG supporters fear those disciplinary measures could include a ban, which would rule Neymar out of Sunday’s showpiece final against either Bayern Munich or Lyon.
The 28-year-old may also be forced to self-isolate for 14 days to guard against the risk of possible infection, which again would see him sit out Sunday’s game.
PSG will take on either Bayern Munich or Lyon in the final on Sunday.
