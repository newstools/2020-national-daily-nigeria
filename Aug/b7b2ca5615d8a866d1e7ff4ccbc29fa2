The former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, on Monday ran to President Muhammadu Buhari for help over the forthcoming governorship election in Edo State.
Oshiomhole was sighted walking through the presidential lounge at the State House with Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, in an arrangement for a meeting with the president.
Sources from the presidency disclosed to National Daily that the Edo governorship election, the plan for his return as APC chairman which the party governors had warned earlier; topped the agenda of the visit.
Oshiomhole has been having a rough relationship with APC governors since his removal as the party’s national chairman. The Progressives Governors had also warned the APC interim leadership on the behaviour of the former Edo governor which they said has been causing the APC and its candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, dwindling electoral fortunes.
