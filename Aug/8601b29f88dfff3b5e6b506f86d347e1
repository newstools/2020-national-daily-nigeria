Lionel Messi has expressed his frustration and anger with Barcelona after details of his meeting with new manager Ronald Koeman was made public.
The 32-year-old cut short his holiday to meet with Koeman on Thursday.
He is believed to have told the new boss that he is considering leaving the Camp Nou.
But Messi is furious by the source of the leak, Catalan radio station RAC1, who have regularly backed under-fire president Josep Bartomeu.
The claims coincide with reports that some Barcelona board wanted Messi to leave the club. It is understood that at least one high-ranking member thinks a shock sale would be best for all involved.
Koeman has already made it clear that he sees Messi as an integral part of his rebuilding project, which will start with several notable departures.
Further talks between Messi and Koeman are scheduled to take place imminently and the members of the board who want the club’s record goalscorer to remain are said to be relaxed about the situation.
