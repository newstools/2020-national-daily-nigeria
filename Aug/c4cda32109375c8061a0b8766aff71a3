Amidst violence and anxiety rocking Edo in the run-up to the September 19 guber election, President Muhammadu Buhari just hosted the APC candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu at Aso Rock.
The meeting on Friday followed public outrage after a series of near-violent activities on the state assembly complex, clandestine meetings of lawmakers, and impeachment of Speakers and deputies.
Ize-Iyamu arrived Aso Rock but was initially unable to see Buhari. He was later taken to him for presentation of the party flag.
Buhari was invited to attend the party rally on Saturday, but he declined.
