There are emerging indicators of plots to impeach Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State in the early hours of Thursday as the Police invaded and took over the Edo State House of Assembly Complex, Benin City.
National Daily gathered that the Police said they were there to prevent attack on the Assembly. But information had it that they are actually on a mission to pave way for the 14 renegade lawmakers loyal to former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to coercively resume and impeach the Speaker of the House of Assembly and subsequently suspend other House members loyal to Governor Godwin Obaseki. Thereafter, they would purportedly commence impeachment proceedings against Governor Obaseki.
It was alleged that the Imo State Governor has provided the Imo State House of Assembly Mace for the yet to inaugurated lawmakers loyal to Oshiomhole to use as the symbol of authority in electing their own Speaker and commence impeachment of Governor Godwin Obaseki.
The Edo Assembly deputy speaker was impeached on Wednesday after his defection from the PDP to the APC. A new deputy speaker was elected.
The former deputy speaker had defected with four other lawmakers among the 10 lawmakers loyal to Obaseki. The Governor is currently left with minority legislators behind him.
