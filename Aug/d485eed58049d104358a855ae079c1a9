Manchester City was on Saturday beaten 3 goals to 1 by Lyon in the Champion League quarter finals in Lisbon after high expectations of getting over to the semifinals of the competition.
Coincidentally, Barcelona was humiliated by Bayern Munich of Germany 8 goals to 2 also in the Champions League semifinals.
Since the humiliating defeat, Manchester City was gathered to be prepared to offer an opportunity for Messi to leave Barcelona, a top club in Spain that has been in disarray since the Bayern Munich defeat, anticipating that Messi would decide to leave Spain.
The 8 – 2 Bayern Munich soccer onslaught left gross frustration in Barcelona which culminated into immediate sack of the coach. Most players are also on line for sack. Messi has been under surveillance over his contemplation to leave Barcelona.
