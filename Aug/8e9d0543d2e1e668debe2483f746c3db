The possibility of another round of fuel scarcity seems to be on the horizon, especially in Lagos as Petroleum Tankers Drivers in Lagos, an affiliates of Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers [NUPENG] has withdrawn their services beginning from today, August 10.
The state chairman, NUPENG, Tayo Aboyeji disclosed this on Monday, noting that the move became necessary following the breakdown of negotiation between leadership of the union and Lagos state government.
Recall that the union had earlier complained of extortion of money from its members by various security agents as well as the menace of containerized trucks at Apapa, Kirikiri, and Beach Land axis areas of the state.
The union also complained of harassment and extortion by area boys as well as area god-fathers who have made the business environment not conducive.
Aboyeji said that the strike began in the early hours of Aug. 10, following a negotiation breakdown between the state government and the union.
“Although, we met with the state government yesterday night (Aug. 9), yet we could not reach an agreement. So, only the tanker drivers in Lagos State proceeded with the strike, because the environment is not conducive for tankers to operate,’’ he said.
NUPENG’s National President, Mr. Williams Akporeha, and General Secretary, Mr Olawale Afolabi had in a joint statement said the directive became necessary due to failure of various authorities in the state to address some pending issues.
NUPENG had on Aug. 7 directed its members to down tools with effect from Aug. 10.
