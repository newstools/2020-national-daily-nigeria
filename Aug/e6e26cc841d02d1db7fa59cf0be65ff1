President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday subtly admitted the failure of the anti-corruption war in the country by his administration. The president in a brief media interaction after Sallah service in Abuja acknowledged the betrayal of trusted and abuse of privileges by people appointed to perform certain duties.
President Buhari speaking on the corruption allegations against the action chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) investigated by a Presidential Panel; and the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), being investigated by the House of Representatives, declared: “There has been an abuse of trust by people trusted by the previous administration and this administration.”
The president, however, disclosed that “A number of assets have been recovered and some money; but we have introduced TSA, Treasury Single Account, where all the money are taken.”
He declared: “I said assets should be sold and the money put into TSA so the money can be identified at any level. And I will see who will come after us and take it back again to those who misappropriate public funds.”
