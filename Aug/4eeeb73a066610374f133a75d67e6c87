Neymar’s agent has suggested a sensational forward line of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and the Brazil star could be possible at Paris Saint-Germain.

And this follows the uncertaint situations sorroundung Messi’s future in Barca in the wake of Barcelona’s 8-2 suffering by Bayern Munich in the UCL quarter-finals.

Insiders say Juventus are willing to do business with any club with right purchasing powers since they dream of bagging the UCL trophy has been dashed on two different attempts since Ronaldo joined tje Serie A side.

Neymar who started this season with an atitude to join Barca has since become a different player in PSG shirts. He’s been highly instrumental in taking the French champs to the UCL final. And his dream to link up with Messi again could come sooner than expected if everything his agent, Wagner Ribeiro, say can be banked on.

Wagner is confident the number 10 will stay in France until at least 2022 and even thinks Messi and Ronaldo could join him at Parc des Princes if PSG’s Qatari owners make the funds available.

“There was a time when he was sad because of his injuries,” Ribeiro told Placar.

“At that time, he was inclined to leave, to return to Barcelona or go to Real Madrid. Not today – you can see how happy he is.

“Living in the ‘City of Light’, where everyone wants to go for a stroll, enjoying French cuisine, living in a beautiful house, friends and family nearby, playing for one of the best clubs with everything a person could need or like… what reason would he have to leave PSG today?”
