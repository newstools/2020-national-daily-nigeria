The two leading parties in Edo state, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are currently engaged in accusations and counter accusations over allegations of illegal printing of PVCs ahead of the September 19 governorship election in the state.
Recall that the PDP, through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, on Sunday at a news conference at the re-election campaign organisation’s office of Governor Godwin Obaseki at the Government Reservation Area (GRA), Benin, levelled the allegations against the leaders and members of the APC.
The party said: “We wrote letters to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Department of State Services (DSS), the police and other security agencies to give them our itineraries for the campaigns.
“APC leaders have discovered that they cannot win a free and fair election. So, they are displaying desperation. Governor Obaseki is sure of winning the election, in view of his impressive performance in almost four years. Edo people are also tired of godfatherism and the use of touts.”
It said Obaseki had no godfather, adding that he would not loot the treasury.
However, reacting to the allegations, the APC, through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Azebamwan, said it was a mark of ignorance for PDP and its spokesman (Nehikhare) to accuse APC leaders of printing PVCs.
It said: “Any politician who does that (printing of PVCs) will be wasting his/her time and money, because INEC’s card readers will reject the fake PVCs.
“PDP leaders are trying to distract and deceive Edo people and other Nigerians about their plot to rig the September 19 governorship election, but it will be an exercise in futility. Edo residents and other Nigerians should ignore the antics, propaganda, misinformation and disinformation of Nehikhare and other members of PDP.”
