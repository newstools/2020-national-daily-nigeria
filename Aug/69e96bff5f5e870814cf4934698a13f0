La liga giant Barcelona may be in for another crisis as the choice of Ronald Koeman as the new manager of the club after the sack of its former coach, Quique Setien, has become an issue for campaign among its presidential candidate.
Current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, is under increasing pressure over the new appointment with elections set to hold on the first match day of March 15, 2021.
He opened up on a plan to re-sign Neymar as Koeman takes over, adding that the club tried to re-sign Neymar last summer. However, Bartomeu admits it might be impossible to bring the Brazilian back from Paris Saint-Germain this year.
Neymar left the Camp Nou in a stunning £198 million move to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017, but has consistently been linked with a return.
The 28-year-old has won three Ligue 1 titles during his time in France and is set to play in the Champions League final for the club on Sunday, while Barca have failed to reach a final since his departure.
Meanwhile, Barcelona presidential candidate, Victor Font, said he will sack Ronald Koeman no matter how well he performs as manager and replace him with club legend Xavi Hernandez.
And speaking on Spanish radio programme El Larguero on Tuesday night, Font said: “Even if Koeman has a great season, I will not change my plans. If I become president, Koeman will not be the coach of Barca in the 2021-22 season.
“Xavi understands that all the puzzles in the club must be put together. Who will lead the team will be decided by the Board of Directors, in our case it will be him [Xavi].
“Messi is completely disappointed because of the critical situation at the club both in sports, and in economic and organisational terms. I expect that Messi will play under Xavi in 2021.”
