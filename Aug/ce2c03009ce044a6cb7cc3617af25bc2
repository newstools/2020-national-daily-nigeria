Throwback Thursday — On Saturday it was reported how the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and other governors elected under the APC stormed out of the palace of the Oba of Benin and jetted back to their bases after waiting for about 4 hours without seeing the Benin monarch.

The APC chieftains were in Benin to kickstart the governorship campaign of the candidate of the APC, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, whose campaign had started hours earlier at the main bowl of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) in Ugbowo Benin City.

It was gathered that the party chieftains, which include Governors of Kaduna, Kano and Yobe State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, Alhaji Abdulahi Ganduje and Mai Mala Buni, respectively, as well as Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, were in the entourage.

The delegation had arrived the palace after landing at the Benin Airport and headed to the Palace expecting to meet with the Oba.

A source said, “They waited for 4 hours and couldn’t see the Oba. They stormed out of the palace and headed to the airport. In a matter of minutes, about three private jets taxied off from the Airport to the sky. They were said to have left in anger.”
