The federal government has hinted on the possibility of reopening schools when certain parameters have been achieved in the fight against the deadly coronavirus pandemic in the country.
Schools, religious and public gatherings were banned about two months ago by the federal government due to the coronavirus outbreak.
After months of closure, government, however, relaxed the ban on religious gatherings for four weeks while schools will remain closed.
While addressing reporters during the 100th-day briefing of the presidential task force on COVID-19 in Abuja, Minister for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire said schools will reopen when the federal government is able to ensure balance in safety and preventing of COVID-19 outbreak across the country.
The minister who didn’t give a tentative date for reopening of schools, said government would continue to monitor and study the situations with a view to deciding when to reopen schools.
According to Ehanire: “There is no fixed date on schools’ resumption. The presidential task force on COVID-19 is studying the situation, carrying out reviews every two and four weeks to assess the situation and judge when it is safe.
“The Federal Government is taking very seriously the balance between safety and preventing of disease explosion, and the opening of schools.
“We are encouraging schools to embrace online training and education as much as possible.
