As part of signs that the global oil market is moving closer to re-balancing, Nigerian Bonny light price against earlier predictions, surged closer to $40, as it closed at $37.57 per barrel mark, up by 5.57% on Wednesday.
This is coming against the backdrop of a decline in crude oil inventory by 483,000 barrels for the week ending May 29, as estimated by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday, and signs that OPEC+ producers are close to agreeing on a short extension of their historic deal to cut output.
According to data from oilprice, the Brent crude was sold for $39.79 per barrel. The American WTI dropped to $36.79 per barrel.
Meanwhile, Russia and some other OPEC+ member countries are pushing for an extension by a month or 2 of the current output cut of 9.7 million barrels per day beyond June. This is within the 1-3 months’ extension that Saudi Arabia is pushing for.
Either way, the market likes the idea of more cuts, with the understanding that going through with the earlier agreed output cut after June, will not be enough to draw down the global oil glut that is negatively affecting prices and building up inventories.
Analysts had predicted an inventory build of over 3 million barrels, and last week, the API had predicted a crude oil inventory of 9.731 million barrels. Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that the inventory was going to be up by 7.9 million barrels by last week.
OPEC members such as Nigeria and Iraq have shown weak compliance in meeting their crude oil production reduction targets set last month.
“Overall, the market is moving in the right direction with the gradual easing of the lockdown. But we still need to be cautious. There is always a risk of another wave of the coronavirus,” the first OPEC source said.
