Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State may have on Monday scolded the suspended national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) when he lamented that the defection of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State from the APC is painful.
Governor Bello during a visit of a delegation of North-Central Governors to the new Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, on Monday,  expressed optimism that APC will survive its crises, outlive its present internal crisis and expand its coast in upcoming elections across the country.
Bello lamenting the exit of Governor Obaseki consoled himself that  APC, despite the exit, is determined to win the Edo State Governorship election in September.
Governor Bello had declared: “APC is going to win Edo State.
“But unfortunately, I really feel the leaving of my colleague, His Excellency Governor Godwin Obaseki in whatever circumstance to another political party, is painful anyway, but as a political party, we are going to take Edo back.”
