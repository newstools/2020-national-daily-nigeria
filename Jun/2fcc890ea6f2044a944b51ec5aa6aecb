Senator Dino Melaye, represented Kogi West in the National Assembly, has ridiculed the ousted national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, who was liquidated by the dissolution of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) by the National Executive Council, (NEC), on Thursday. The former senator mocked Oshiomhole to solemn ignominy as a disgraced former chairman.
Dino Melaye celebrating the fall of Oshiomhole made a broadcast on his Facebook: “Why did Buhari, APC take Oshiomole to Golgotha?
“Meanwhile, myself and Sen Saraki are waiting for our retirement letter from the disgraced former chairman.”
The APC NEC meeting was attended by President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, leaders of the National Assembly, 10 APC governors and other qualified members.
The NWC was replaced with a Caretaker Committee. Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State was appointed Chairman of the Caretaker Committee.
Melaye mocked Oshiomhole to have fallen into broken pieces that cannot be put together again.
