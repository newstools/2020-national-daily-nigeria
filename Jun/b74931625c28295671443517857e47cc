President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the next phase of covid-19 lockdown lift, covering most aspects except one: religion.
On Monday, the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 announced lifting of restriction in most of the sectors, including commercial air flight, partial reopening of schools, inter-state travel bans.
But churches, mosques, and other centres of worship got no mention during the announcement.
In the last address by the PTF, the ban on worship was consigned to state government, with advice that they collaborate with religious leaders on guidelines for churches and mosques.
But the collaboration collapsed. The governors thereafter decided the ban should remain.
