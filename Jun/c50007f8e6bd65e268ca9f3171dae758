There are emerging signals of looming protests in some states over continuous closure of churches and mosques by governors despite the directive by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. The PTF had on Monday directed that churches and mosques and reopen for congregational worship effect from Tuesday.
However, Governor Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, thereafter, insisted that churches and mosques cannot be reopened yet in the state considering that Lagos is the epicentre of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. The Lagos governor considered it premature for churches and mosques to be reopened at this stage of battle with coronavirus in the state.
Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State also expressed reservations over the reopening of churches and mosques or other religious worship centres in the state.
Several other governors, though silent on the issue, are yet to comply with the directive. However, several governors had reopened churches and mosques in their states even before the PTF directive.
Meanwhile, those affected by the resistance of some governors  to reopen their worship centres and denying them their freedom of worship after months of restrictions which have been lifted, are beginning to run out of patience and are threatening mass action in the various stares where the restrictions and continuous closure of worship centres are sustained.
