Governor Godwin Obaseki has finally joined the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) after many days of suspense and political meetings
Obaseki was received by the leadership of the party, led by the State Chairman, Hon. Tony Aziegbemi, on Friday.
He arrived the State Secretariat of the PDP in Benin, the Edo State capital, with many of his followers and appointees, where he declared his intention in a short speech.
Obaseki had on Tuesday visited the State House to inform President Muhammadu Buhari about his decision to quit the APC, but he was unable to see the president. Rather, he met with the Chief of Staff to the president, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.
He later told State House reporters that he came to formally inform the president of his resignation from the APC to enable him to realise his re-election bid on the platform of another party.
He said having finally decided to leave APC, the platform that brought him to power, he had deemed it necessary to inform the president of his decision.
