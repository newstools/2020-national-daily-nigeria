“We still have tomorrow, Friday and Saturday for the petitioners to come around. I want to thank you for your patience and for being prompt with your attendance.

“This is not the first time that we are having this kind of issue. It has happened in the National Assembly before.

“It is an allegation, we cannot just go to court. We have to find out the facts and figures. It is not just against the Speaker of the House.

“The House once investigated an issue against the former Governor of the state. We must build something on something for us to have a cause of action,” he said.


Hon. Akande revealed that SaharaReporters, which he said is the most important party in the matter, received and acknowledged the receipt of the invite of the House through their email address.

He added that most of the invitees did not have permanent addresses, and that the House sent invitations to them through their email addresses, and the means they used to make their allegations against the Speaker.
