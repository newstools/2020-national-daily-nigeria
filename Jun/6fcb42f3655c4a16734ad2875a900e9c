Governor Godwin Obaseki has continued to consolidate on his chances of securing the governments ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State.Â Another governorship aspirant, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who had earlier approached the court to stop Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries, stepped down for the governor hours to the commencement of the primaries on Thursday. Obaseki has subtly neutralized political forces outside Edo State or the PDP who plotted to obstruct him from the PDP governorship ticket and restored remarkable cooperation on the party.
Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama had approached the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, seeking an injunction to restrict Obaseki from participating in the PDP primary election on Thursday. After negotiations and horse trading, Ihama withdrew the suit, leading the case being struck out by the court.
Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama took further steps to withdraw from the governorship primary election, conceding his support to Obaseki.
Obaseki may be left with Kenneth Imasuegbon as a strong opponent to contend with at the poll. However, the stepping down of two aspirants in anticipation of more could swing the pendulum in favour of Obaseki at the poll.
