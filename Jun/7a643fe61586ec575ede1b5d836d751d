Former Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dankwambo, on Friday welcomed Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after the governor’s official defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State. Dankwambo in his message on the social media wrote: “Welcome to the family of democrats, Governor Godwin Obaseki and Deputy, Philip Shaibu.”
Governor Obaseki in a broadcast on his facebook page declared: “I have officially joined the Official Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to advance my ambition to seek re-election as Governor of Edo.
“I, as always, remain committed to engendering good governance and sustainable development of our dear state.” He had promised members of the PDP good leadership in Edo State.
Meanwhile, stakeholders in Edo State have warned all political parties, the INEC, police and army to eschew from rigging the governorship election in Edo State.
“No rigging, no inconclusive election, no compromise of election result collation centre, no police or army interference. Forward ever,” they declared.
Some others told APC supporters in Oshiomhole’s ward not to defect to PDP during the elections but remain in APC to sustain the suspension.
“Please those APC members in Oshiomhole’s ward should not cross over to PDP during elections. They should sit tight and ensure his suspension at the local level is maintained and sustained. Best wishes to Obaseki and PDP,” they said.
