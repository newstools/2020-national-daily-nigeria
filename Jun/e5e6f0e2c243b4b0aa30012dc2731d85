APC Deputy National Secretary Victor Giadom has addressed a press conference ias the party’s acting national chairman while Senator Abiola Ajimobi whom the party announced to occupy the post has also addressed the party.
Giadom arrived at the APC’s national secretariat Abuja this morning, where he held a press conference, and call for the screening exercise that resulted in the disqualification of the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, to be cancelled.
The crisis in the APC spiked on Tuesday when the appel court upheld the suspension of the party’s chairman Adams Oshiomhole.
While Giadom is holding to the March court order that made him the party’s acting chairman, Ajimobi is only appealing for peace until he can call the party’s National Executive Council to decide the way forward.
