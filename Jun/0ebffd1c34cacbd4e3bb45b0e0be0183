The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) late on Saturday,  uphold the disqualification of Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Edo State by the party’s screening committee restraining him from contesting the party’s primary election for the governorship elections in Edo State.
The APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole explained that Obaseki, besides presenting faulty certificates, abused his powers as Governor of Edo State.
The APC appeal committee had on Saturday ratified disqualification of Obaseki by the screening committee on Friday.
The appeal committee at a press briefing in Abuja on Saturday accepted the decision of the APC screening committee to disqualify the Edo governor from the primaries because of the perceived faulty NYSC Certificate presented to the party.
However, the appeal committee held unnecessary session because Obaseki did not contact the members for intervention. So, they acted in frivolities.
The NWC is the Supreme Court on the screening as declared by Oshiomhole.
