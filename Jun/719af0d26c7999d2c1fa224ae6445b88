President Muhammadu Buhari has added a new dimension to the crisis rocking the ruling APC at both the national and state levels.
Buhari just snubbed Ekiti Gov Kayode Fayemi and the litigious self-styled Acting National chairman Victor Giadom that came to see him.
The two of them were said to have visited the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Tuesday but were unable to meet the president.
The Edo crisis and suspension of the national chairman Adams Oshiomhole has not only mocked the APC whose overall leader is Buhari, but it has polarized the APC governors.
No fewer than 13 have aligned as Oshiomole backers, whose grand patron is the party’s national leader Bola Tinubu.
Seven other governors are against Oshiomhole—in support of the brinkmanship Giadom is playing by using court orders to ruffle the party and its NWC. Giadom has even called his own NEC meeting inside Aso Rock despite the NWC replacing him already.
Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi is believed by many to be the hand in the gloves.
Amaechi has, however, denied this, saying he has stood aloof from partisan politics, wondering why the APC and its NWC  made up of adults cannot manage the party’s internal crisis.
Fayemi and Giadom  could only meet with Buhari’s Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari.
As chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, Fayemi, ordinarily, deserves some attention from the president amidst the spiralling party crisis.
