The Federal Government this Monday evening, June 29, 2020, announced the reopening of schools as part of modifications to the COVID-19 lockdown, the phase two of which it extended for another 30 days.
The resumption is, however, limited to graduating JSS 3 and SSS 3 preparing to write their final examinations.
Chairman of the COVID-19 Presidential Task Force (PTF), Boss Mustapha, announced this during today’s briefing by the Task Force in Abuja.
He also announced the lifting of the ban on inter-state movement but excluding the curfew period of 10pm–4am.
Mr. Mustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), equally announced that airports would soon reopen in phases.
The media briefing was still in progress as at the time of this report.
Recall that the Managing Director, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, Captain Rabiu Yadudu, at the weekend announced that two flights will not be allowed to fly from the same terminal within the same time for safety purposes.
According to him, FAAN had informed the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, of its plan, which he said would restrict multiple departures of flights.
Captain Yadudu stressed: “We have already told NCAA of plans to space the flights. No two airlines will depart at the same time from our airports.
“The spacing is not to make things difficult for the airline operators, but to protect their staff and other users of our airports.”
