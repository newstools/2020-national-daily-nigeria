There is obviously no relief yet for the embattled national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, who lost both his membership and leadership of the party since his suspension by his ward in Edo State. There were indications of covert attempts to manipulate the party for extra-legal lifting of the suspension on the former APC national chairman. Accordingly, the APC Ward 10 Chairamn, Etsako West Local Government Area, Oshawo Stephen,   at a meeting in Benin City, on Friday, at the APC Secretariat, said reports that the party has lifted the suspension of Oshiomhole from APC was fake news, saying that the man who made the announcement is a domestic a servant to Oshiomhole and not a member of the Ward 10 Executive.
The APC Ward 10 Chairman, Etsako West LGA, in a media interaction declared that Oshiomhole remains suspended from APC. Oshawo Stephen declared: “nothing has changed, the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole is still there. If there is meeting, I supposed to be at that meeting because I am the authentic Chairman of Ward 10.
“Those that stand here with me now, they are members of the executive so that people can see. I don’t believe in paper; that report is fake news. Oshoke that is talking is a domestic servant of Oshiomhole, he is not a member of the executive.
“If anything happens that Oshiomhole’s matter will be resolved, let him come and gather all of us and, then, we lift his suspension.
“There’s nothing like that; they are still with me. Since they are with me, they are still intact. None of them has left for the other side.”
More so, APC Chairman in Etsako West LGA, Ezolomhe Rabiat, also maintained that the local government executives are still APC members in the state and have not defected to any other party.
