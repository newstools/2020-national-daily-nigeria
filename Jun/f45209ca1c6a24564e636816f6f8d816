A leading advocate of good governance in Nigeria, Femi Fani-Kayode, has condemned the attempted assassination of Nigeria’s First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, at the Presidential Villa by a Personal Assistant to the president. Fani-Kayode chided the Personal Assistant for ordering his security details to fire gun shots in the seat of power to assault the president’s wife and the children. He demanded protection of the First Lady while decrying that the Personal Assistant who ought to be thrown out of the Villa immediately was allowed to go free with his reckless impunity.
Fani-Kayode challenged the president to restore the respect and dignity of the wife and save her from the cruel and primitive cabal in State House.
Femi Fani-Kayode’s protest statement read: “I have heard the details of what actually transpired at the Villa a couple of nights ago and I am utterly appalled.
“How can a Personal Assistant to the President order his men to fire shots in the air in an attempt to intimidate and threaten Aisha Buhari and the President’s children after hurling unprintable insults at them?
“No matter how one feels about Buhari and his government, this is unacceptable. The First Lady deserves to be respected; she also needs to be protected from the ruthless cabal of cruel and primitive misogynists that hold sway in the Villa before something terrible happens. You cannot shoot guns to threaten someone’s wife and still claim to love him.
“The insolent and heartless Personal Assistant that was responsible for this reckless affront and brutal assault ought to be grabbed by the Scutum, drawn to the front gate and thrown out of the Villa. He is a danger to the First Lady, a liability to the president and a disgrace to the nation.”
