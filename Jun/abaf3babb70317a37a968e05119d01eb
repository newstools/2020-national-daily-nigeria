Jaiz Bank Plc says it has closed down its branch in Ikeja, Lagos, following the confirmation that one of its staff in the branch has tested positive to the dreaded COVID-19 virus
In an email that was sent out to customers, the non-interest explained that it does not want any more of its staff or customers to contract the virus, hence the shutdown. In the meantime, the infected staff is currently in isolation, even as customers who visited the branch last week were advised to self-quarantine for two weeks.
“The branch has been shut down for the safety of our customers and staff and immediate disinfection of the branch will take place to eliminate any cause for worry,” part of the email said.
The bank expressed its apology for any inconvenience the branch’s closure may cause customers, and also assured that the branch will be reopened as soon as it has been certified safe for business activities.
Jaiz Bank’s share price is currently trading at N0.59 on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, down from a previous open of N0.60. The Islamic bank, which has a market capitalisation of about N17.4 billion, reported a profit after tax of N2.4 billion in its latest earnings report which was for FY 2019.
This is not the first time a Nigerian bank would be shutting down its branch following a COVID-19 scare. Just last week, Wema Bank Plc also did the same after two cases of the virus were reported in two of its branches across the country.
