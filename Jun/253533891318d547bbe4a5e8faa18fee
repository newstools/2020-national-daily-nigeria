Less than 48 hours to the PDP primary for the Edo guber election, there’s no head way in the efforts to strong-arm the three aspirants the party already cleared for the primary election to adopt the party’s star aspirant Godwin Obaseki.
A meeting that held Saturday night between PDP Govs Aminu Tamuwal, Nyesom Wike, Ifeanyi Okowa, Obaseki, and the three other conestansts deadlocked—in spite of the pressure from the stalwarts.
“It is disappointing and a big shame in Edo State and the entire nation and it portends danger for the country and the party,” said Imasuegbon.
“Nigerians should rise up against what is happening. We are not in the jungle; it is not a do-or-die affair, but about the process. It is totally unacceptable.”
Obaseki, for whom the governors are sweating, just crossed over from the APC where his dodgy credentials were pressed home to discredit and disqualify him from the party’s primary.
His problem dates back to over a year ago when he baulked at the pull from his godfather and predecessor and national chairman Adams Oshiomhole.
The embattled governor and his ambition have divided his new party. There’s now a groundswell of rebellion and protest by party members and caucuses who insist the PDP leadership should honor loyalty—not grabbing opportunity.
Immasuegbon has vowed not to take it lightly if the party decides to hand Obaseki the ticket.
“It is not about pressure, but about doing the right thing in line with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, due process and the Electoral Act,’ he said.
