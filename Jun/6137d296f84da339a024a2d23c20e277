The lawmakers in Kaduna State House of Assembly engaged in free for all fight, exchanging blows during proceedings on impeachment of the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Mukhtar Hazo, on Thursday.
The Assembly was earlier beefed up with security before the arrival of the lawmakers with the hindsight of the impeachment of the deputy speaker, which 24 members signed the impeachment notice.
While the deputy speaker was impeached, there were insinuations that by seven lawmakers loyal to the former deputy speaker had plotted to impeach the Speak of the House, Rt. Hon Yusuf Zailani.
Lawmakers loyal to the former deputy speaker threw the House into pandemonium when they attempted to frustrate the impeachment of the deputy speaker, turning the House into boxing ring to carry the mace out of the House.
The lawmakers subsequently elected Isaac Auta, member representing Kauru Constituency, in the House to succeed Hazo after the impeachment.
