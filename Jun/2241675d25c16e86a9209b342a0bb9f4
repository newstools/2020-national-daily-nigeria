Determined to ensure the Completion of all ongoing projects before the expiration of the current administration, Delta state government on Thursday ordered the contractors handling the various market projects in the state to site
Delta state Commissioner for Trade and Investments, Mr. Chika Ossai who spoke to Journalists in Asaba, said that the state government has remobilized all the contractors with enough funds to ensure Completion of all the projects, especially the market projects in various Communities in the state
Noting that some of the markets include: Central Market Bomadi in Bomadi Community, Government modern market, Otu- Jeremi , Modern market Okwagbe ,both in Ughelli South Local Government Area of the state and Udu harbour market in Udu Local Government Area of the state, Ossai disclosed that each of the market projects he visited was an eye sore,  however expressed displeasure over the slow pace of work by the various Contractors, warning that the state government would invoke its power to ensure that the contractors are dragged to Court.
The contractors had in their defence, blamed the delay in delivering the projects as required, and alleged poor funding on the part of the state government, especially in the release of funds
One of the contractors, Tim Engineering Company who spoke to Journalists said” we have not been mobilized in terms of funding and we will not use our money to work, so the state government has its own side of the Challenges, and we cannot afford to spend our money to complete the project”
Speaking further, Commissioner Ossai said the three markets are in Bomadi, Okwagbe, Otu- Jeremi and Udu.
“We have seen what the contractors are doing, but they have not really done enough, the contractors did complain of poor funding but I can assure you that in this government since 2015, we are doing everything within our capacity to ensure that the contractors get enough funds to execute their projects”
The Commissioner however assured Deltans that the state government will not leave any job unfinished at the expiration of its tenure, adding that” Okowa will complete all Jobs before he leaves Office in 2023”
