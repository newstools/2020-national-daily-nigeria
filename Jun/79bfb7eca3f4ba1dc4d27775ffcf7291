The former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, may have on Saturday disowned former members of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) under his leadership over alleged intention to sue the APC on the dissolution of the committee on Thursday. Oshiomhole at a press conference in Abuja on Saturday declared his acceptance of the dissolution of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) by the National Executive Committee (NEC) at an emergency meeting on Thursday.
Oshiomhole indicated no intention to resist the decision of the NEC meeting but rather indicated his loyalty to President Muhammadu Buhari remains unshaken, assuring of his loyalty to the ruling APC,
He noted that the real test of his loyalty is not limited to when things are going smoothly but when things suddenly turn rough.
“Of course, we have now been dissolved and I have accepted that dissolution in good fate. I have always assured the President of my loyalty.
“I know it is easy for people to speak of loyalty when the going is good but loyalty is brought to the test when the going gets really tough,” Oshiomhole declared.
Oshiomhole highlighted his achievement to include building unity and cooperation between the ninth National Assembly leadership and President Buhari. He said: “The emergence of Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has helped the executive arm of government to succeed.”
The NWC was dissolved on the recommendation of President Buhari at the APC National Executive Committee (NEC).
Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State was appointed chairman of the 13-member Caretaker Committee and was sworn in by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. Senator John Akpan Udo-Edehe was appointed secretary of the caretaker committee.
