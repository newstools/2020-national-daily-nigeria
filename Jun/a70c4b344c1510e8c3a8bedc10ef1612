Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State on Saturday admitted that Fulani herdsmen carry guns and causing violence in Nigeria. The Kano governor expressing deep concern over the raging Fulani herdsmen attacks in the country, counseled President Muhammadu Buhari to restrain armed Fulani herdsmen from entering into Nigeria from other African countries. The governor insisted that the Federal Government should stop the herdsmen from other African countries from entering Nigeria to curb the crime wave perpetuated by the Fulani herdsmen in the country.
Ganduje commissioning 25 housing units of RUGA settlement project at Dansoshiya forest, in Kiru Local Government Area, Kano State, indicated that, “This is the first batch of the housing units of 25 out of 200 units earmarked for construction.” He maintained that the demand on Buhari has become imperative to “successfully and effectively prevent the coming of herdsmen from other African countries, because they come to this country with guns and other weapons. Which flame the clash between herders and farmers.”
Governor said that Dansoshiya RUGA, is the nucleus of RUGA settlement project towards forestalling herdsmen conflicts in the state.
The governor had declared: “We engaged in this project for three fundamental reasons, first and foremost is to avoid clashes between farmers and herders, secondly, to avoid movement of herders which is the source of conflict and to avoid cattle rustling.
“It is absolutely necessary to improve and modernise breeding system for Fulani cattle. As it is clear that a gallon of milk is more expensive than one gallon of petrol, it is, therefore, necessary for us to utilize this great opportunity.”
Ganduje promised to build school and hospital in the settlement to enable the settlers have access to education and good health care.
