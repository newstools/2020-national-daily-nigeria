Social Media Platforms have been busy with the Netflix documentary about HushPuppiâ€™s arrest and the death of former Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi.

However, there is a new trend that has taken over the streets of Twitter, Night Market. Night Market is a situation online where people can buy and sell online with a substantial discount.

The idea was replicated and gotten from the normal Night Market as seen in states like Lagos , Abuja and other cities.
