Former vice president and perennial presidential contestant Atiku Abubakar will be contesting the presidency again in 2023.
His son, Adamu Atiku-Abubakar, revealed this while presenting the yearly scorecard of his ministry as the commissioner for works and energy in Adamawa June 7.
“Personally, I don’t see anything wrong with my father contesting for the presidency. In 2023,” said Adamu.
“My father will be aspiring to the number one office in the land because he has been an astute, strategic, master politician for almost four decades.”
Many have predicted Atiku will be shooting for Aso Rock again in 2023, the fifth attempt in about two decades. He will be 76 then.
But within the PDP, the last party that offered him its ticket, there are elements, especially the southeastern bloc, already spoiling for war at the early hints Atiku will bid for ticket again.
The PDP, however, swiftly quelled the rising sentiments and speculations on where the party will be zoning its presidential ticket in 2023.
“Behind the speculation are political terrorists whose plan is to mislead the public and cause disaffection within the ranks of our party with the hope of using such fabrications to further their own selfish political ambitions, said Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP’s national publicity secretary in December.
Whether the party admits this or not, Atiku is gunning for Nigeria’s to job again in the next election.
As party leader and man of means, the former veep has enough clout and influence to work the party into giving him the ticket.
It won’t be easy for the ruling party, though.
In fact, with his announcement of his father’s unequivocal bid for 2023, Adamu  might just have muddied up the already murky water of the 2023 presidential politicking in the PDP.
