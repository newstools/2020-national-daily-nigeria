APC former chairman Adams Oshiomhole has found his vice at last, after series of humiliation by a bunch of governors and a powerful minority of the NWC—and a big let-down by President Muhammadu Buhari.
In a press conference on the weekend in Abuja, Oshiomhole made a couple of revelations that in some way paint the Buhari as a betrayer and Machiavellian leader.
Oshiomhole said Buhari asked him to head APC in a bid to reform the party and turn its fortune around in 2018
“The president told me then that if we did not reform the All Progressives Congress, we can as well forget about 2019. Those were his exact words,’ Oshiomhole said.
The rotten APC Buhari wanted out then then was under the leadership of former Chairman John Odigie-Oyegun, a host of other executives that eventually hopped into the PDP.
This might counter the widespread belief that the APC national leader installed Oshiomhole as chairman.
Fo Buhari’s party  reform challenge, the Edo former governor knew what he was getting into—that it would be a tough one. With his eyes opened, Oshiomhole said he accepted ihe invitation.
“I am happy that at the end of the day, the 2019 elections have come and gone and thanks to Nigerian people, our president had more votes in 2019 than we had in 2015 and we have more members in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” he said.
He however noted the president, who used him to reform the party, nd win the 2019 election, was also the one who id him down.
“The bottom line is that the President who invited me to lead the party and who mobilised all the support for my emergence as chairman also presided over the meeting where the NWC has now been dissolved,” said Oshiomhole.
That might sound like lamentation of a man used and dumped.
But he was careful enough not to go at Buhari full blast.
