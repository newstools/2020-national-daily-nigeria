Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Tuesday officially resigned from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
Governor Obaseki after closed door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, the on Tuesday, announced his exit from the APC.
Subsequently, the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu also announced his resignation from the APC in Benin City on Tuesday.
Governor Obaseki after his illegal disqualification from the APC primary election to nominate the party’s candidate for the September 19 governorship in Edo State, declared that he would make his decision known after consultation with President Buhari, which he did on Tuesday.
Chairman of the APC Screening Committee, Professor Jonathan Ayuba, last Friday, in the committee’s report to the APC National Working Committee (NWC) affirmed the disqualification  of Governor Obaseki in the screening participated by five other aspirants who include  Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the anointed candidate of Oshiomhole,  Dr. Pius Odubu, Chris Ogiemwonyi, Osaro Obazee, and Matthew Iduoriyekemwen.
Governor had last weekend paid courtesy visits to Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State. The visits confirmed the speculations of Obaseki defecting to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The two governors have similar history of dealing with godfathers and surviving their rigging machines.
Meanwhile, Obaseki’s formal defection to PDP is widely awaited.
