The suspended national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, may be bouncing back to office as the APC, Ward 10, Etsako West Local Government Area, Edo State, cleared him off the suspension from the party which has been the genesis of Oshiomholeâ€™s legal battle for the leadership of the party. Relief came the way of the embattled APC national chairman when 17 of the 27 executive members of APC in ward 10 Etsako West lifted the suspension of Oshiomhole from the party. The ward exco notified the resolution to the APC National working Committee in Abuja on Saturday.
The ward party leaders were said to have disclosed that they made the resolution to lift the suspension after the review of the circumstances that prompted the suspension of Oshiomhole, adding that they found no merit in the allegation or processes adopted in the decision to suspend the national chairman in November 2019.
