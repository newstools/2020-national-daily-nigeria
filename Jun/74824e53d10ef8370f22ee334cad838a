Edo Gov. Godwin Obaseki has presented his nomination form for re-election to President Muhammadu Buhari in a move to spite the seven APC governors and party leader Bola Tinubu who equally met in Lagos on Edo guber election in September.
The Lagos group had met Tinubu on how to resolve the eternal crisis between the APC governor and his predecessor Adams Oshiomhole who also doubles as the party national chairman.
Obaseki had kicked against the decision of the NWC to adopt direct primary in the state. But Tinubu insisted the NWC decision stands.
The directive, many believe, could affect the chances of the governor who is contesting the party ticket with a PDP returnee Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
Iyamu is Oshiomhole candidate, and Obaseki’s nemesis. Both of the aspirants have picked the party nomination forms in Abuja.
Obaseki’s running to Abuja is not absolutely unexpected since Tinubu has supported his man Friday Oshiomhole by endorsing the direct primary.
