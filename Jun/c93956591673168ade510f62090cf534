Osun Gov Adegboyega Oyetola and his predecessor and Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola have clashed openly now—but by proxies. And the cause of the fight might be a trifle.
The rivalry between the two has heated up the ruling APC in the state.
The two camps are fighting over the demolition of Aregbesola’s banner at Isale Aro, Osogbo.
Supporters of the former governor accused Adegboyega’s Ileri Oluwa group of willful damage of the purported banner May 31.
The billboard was mounted by one advertising agent, Femi Siyanbola, and sponsored by a political group, Jaleyemi for Good Governance.They hve been paying the dtate government for it.
Femi said the group made a new banner bearing the same image of Interior Minister, Aregbesola, having made the necessary payment into the coffers of the State Government for the month of June, 2020 but was attacked by some hoodlums.
Trying to replace the damaged board, the group received threats from some thugs in the area, claiming Aregbesola’s banner would not be allowed again in the place.
The group’s lawyer, Barrister Muftau Abiodun, has filed a petition for unlawful removal and destruction of billboard, calling on the police for protection, investigation and prosecution of the matter.
But the police arrested the hoodlums who destroyed the billboard. And they denied they were sent to destroying ad prop.
Oyetola and Aregbesola have fought hard and long such that the state former governor and elder statesman Bisi Akande has made hopeless effort to settle the rift. Nothing works.
And both, Aregbesola and Oyetola, are men of the ruling APC Bola Tinubu.
