The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, on Sunday debunked speculations that he is instigating the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, on allegations of corruption.
Senator Omo-Agege in a statement on Sunday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga, disowned a letter supposedly dispatched by the Clerk of the Senate, claiming to be acting on his behalf, demanding the acting Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, to investigate the Minister of Niger Delta. The Deputy Senate President stated that the letter did not emanate from him neither did he authorize such letter, saying the document is fake. Omo-Agege maintained that he never directed the Clerk of the Senate or any principal staff of the Senate to recommend or communicate to the EFCC to investigate any minister.
The statement read: “The attention of the Office of the Deputy President of the Senate has been drawn to a letter dated 7th May 2020, purportedly written by the Clerk of the Senate acting on behalf of the Office of Deputy President of the Senate requesting the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate and monitor the Honourable Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and one other.
“This Office hereby states that the said letter is false, fake, malicious, mischievous and vexatious.
“This Office never instructed the Clerk of the Senate, or in fact any person, to write to or contact the EFCC in relation to any person.”
The Deputy Senate President, Omo-Agege, appealed to Nigerians to disregard the letter, describing it as the handiwork of persons with criminal intents.
