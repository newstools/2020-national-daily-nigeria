The members of Buhari Youth Organisation(BYO) has described the demise of Senator Bayo Osinowo as a huge loss of a grassroots politician whose absence will be felt across the sociopolitical divides of the state.
BYO’s Lagos State Chapter in a jointly signed statement by its Secretary Comrade Aderibigbe Razaq and the State Coordinator Comrade Abdulwaheed Odunuga, made available to newsmen notes that the news of late Osinowo’s death was a rude shock to the organisation,having been an erudite Lagos politician who represented Lagos East senatorial district in the National Assembly, before his demise was suddenly announced.
“Senator Adebayo Sikiru Osinowo, ‘Pepperito’, as he is fondly called was a four-time member of the Lagos State House of Assembly and until his death a Federal Lawmaker  also a grassroot personality that will be miss by a lot of Lagosians.
“Our deepest condolences goes to his family members, party members and the District he represented, as words alone cannot express the shock and sympathies of this loss. May his soul rest in peace. Amen”.
