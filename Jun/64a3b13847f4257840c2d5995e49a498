The Oyo state government is opening up the state now after months-long restriction following the spread of covid-19 to Nigeria in February.
By month ending, schools, government offices, and worship centres will be re-opening—despite the growing rate of the infection in the state and across the nation.
The state COVID-19 Task Force made decision public on June 15 after a meeting Gov. Seyi Makinde presided over.
According to Makinde’s spokesman, Taiwo Adisa, the resumption of classes for Primary Six, JSS3 and SS3 students begins Monday, June 29. This is to help them prepare for major exams.
The only exemption is the tertiary level which the task force will review later.
But the federal government has yet to determine when to reopen school, stating it will nly happen after the inter-state travel ban currently in place is lifted.
Also approved was the resumption of work by all categories of workers at the state secretariat from June 22.
The government has permitted the opening of mosques and churches to operate at 25 percent capacity.
All worshippers are to compulsorily wear face masks, while the situation will be reviewed within the first two weeks.
Public gatherings have also been limited to 25 persons.
The state secretariat earlier shut on March 27 and later reopened to staff on grade level 13 and above from April 27, would now be open to all other staffers from Monday, June 22.
