Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba has said the state government which banned interstate lockdown will determine when schools will re-open in Nigeria..
Nwajiuba stated this during the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 daily briefing in Abuja on Monday.
According to him, the federal government is not willing to take chances with the health of children.
“As soon as those in charge of the blockade lift it because there is no way we can open our schools if teachers can’t come. We are looking at somewhere after the interstate lockdown is lifted.
“Because we will need that kind of openness for the children to move,” Nwajiuba said.
The government had warned before now it was not in a hurry to re-open schools, giving no specifics about the reason for its decision.
