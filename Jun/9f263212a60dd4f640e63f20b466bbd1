Array of civil society are recounting the loss of a legendary crusader for equity, justice, liberty, rule of law, good governance, adherence to democratic principles and others, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav.
Abubakar Tsav died at the Federal Medial Centre (FMC), Makurdi, Benue State, on Monday, at the age 82 years. He was subsequently buried at the Makurdi Cemetery later on Monday in accordance with Islamic injunctions.
Family source revealed that Abubakar Tsav had protracted illness for which he was receiving treatment at the FMC, Makurdi when he died.
Tsav was retired Commissioner of Police; and was CP of Lagos Police Command.
Abubakar Tsav took civil society by storm when he relinquished his status as beneficiary and member of the ruling elite in Nigeria to expose the ill of the ruling elite in the country, and sustained advocacy for better welfare and opportunities for the poor. Even when Tsav had committed class suicide, fighting the very ruling class he belonged, he stood out in objective criticisms, devoting this time and resource to disseminate information on his advocacies to the public arena through the media intermediaries.
Tsav would spend time on his telephone handset to patiently and meticulously type lengthy statement on his phone, sending them in batches, as the telephone service provider approves, to his friends in the media for publication at his cost.
Tsav stood for the masses, made advocacy for the masses, and lived for all without discrimination.
Civil society has overtly recorded a huge loss in the demise of Abubakar Tsav. Civil society celebrates Abubakar Tsav as a patriot and a nationalist.
