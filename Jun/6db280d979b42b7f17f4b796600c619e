Former Senate leader, Ali Ndume, has explained why he decided to stand as surety for the ex- chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, who is on trial for an alleged N2bn fraud.
Ndume, who is currently the chairman, Senate Committee on Army, said he was not only representing the good, but also the bad and ugly.
Maina’s lawyer on Tuesday told a Federal High Court in Abuja that Ndume had agreed to stand as his client’s surety.
Confirming the development when he spoke to newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday, Ndume, who represents Borno South at the Senate said, “It took me over six months to agree to be his surety” since his bail condition required a serving senator.
He said he took the decision also because of Maina’s health condition.
“Third, his offence is bail able and lastly I am not saying the court should discharge and acquit him. If he is guilty, he will be sentenced. It was a hard decision I had to make. I have a duty to represent the good, the bad and the ugly of Borno South,” Ndume said.
In July of 2015, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) charged Maina alongside a former Head of Service, Steve Oronsaye, Osarenkhoe Afe and Fredrick Hamilton B Global Services Limited before a Federal High Court on a 24-count charge bordering on procurement fraud and obtaining by false pretense.
In November of 2015, EFCC declared Maina a wanted man and launched a manhunt for the former chairman of the PTTPR.
Maina, who is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged fraud has been in detention since November 2019.
One of the conditions given by the court is for the defendant to provide a senator who would stand as a surety for him.
