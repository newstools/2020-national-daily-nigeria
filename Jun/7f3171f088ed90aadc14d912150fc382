The former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, on Friday warned that dire consequences await the ruling APC in Edo State over the illegal disqualification of Governor Godwin Obaseki  from the primary election to nominate the party’s candidate for the governorship election if the decision is not reversed.
Oyegun said Obaseki’s disqualification by APC screening committee appointed by APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, has hidden plot to install a stooge to open opportunities for some persons to have unrestrained access to the Edo State treasury.
For Oyegun, the disqualification is not a surprise, stating that it clearly shows internal democracy has been destroyed in APC, lamenting that APC is a party founded on principles of fair play and good conscience; but all that have been destroyed by the leadership.
The former national chairman expressed that fear if Oshiomole will not go down in history as undertaker of APC.
Oyegun chided Oshiomole for behaving unconstitutionally, while using Obaseki as scape goat.
Oyegun, therefore admonished that if APC does not reverse Obaseki’s disqualification speedily, the party will suffer dire consequences in Edo State in the governorship election. The former national chairman maintained that, “As a matter of fact, Oshiomole is, indeed, the one who is guilty of anti-party, not Obaseki.”
