The Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman, has said leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) like President Muhammadu Buhari, Bola Tinubu, Chief Bisi Akande, Chief Ogbonnaya Onu and Chief Tony Momoh should be blamed for the crisis rocking the party at the moment.
In a statement issued by Lukman on Thursday, he said the inability of these leaders to resolve the crisis shows that the party was collapsing with no leader in charge.
“How can a party so blessed with experienced and very skillful leaders such as Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chief Bisi Akande, Chief Ogbonnaya Onu, Chief Tony Momoh, etc. be incapable of resolving the problem of leadership rocking the party.
“The combined moral authority of President Buhari and Asiwaju Tinubu should have involuntarily moderated the conduct of other leaders of the party, especially members of the NWC.
“Does the current APC leadership crisis, therefore, suggest the declining moral authority of our two leaders? It is very easy to reach conclusions,” he said.
An Appeal Court ruling suspending Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of APC had led to a leadership crisis in the ruling party.
Following the ruling, APC Deputy National Secretary Victor Giadom declared himself Oshiomhole’s replacement.
However, APC National Working Committee, NWC, had appointed former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi as acting chairman.
