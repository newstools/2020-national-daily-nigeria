Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu  has tested positive for coronavirus.
The governor hustling for his re-election campaign confirmed his status on his Twitter handle on Tuesday.
“Today, I tested positive for #COVID19. All is well. I’m asymptomatic and have been self isolating. Work continues. Your continued prayers over my well being are most appreciated,” he tweeted.
His confirmation came hours after his APC counterpart in Kogi Yahaya Bello insisted Covid-19 is all about creating fears for Nigeria, and the government bought it into the foreign conspiracy.
Akeredolu becomes the fifth governor to have contracted the virus in Nigeria since its spread to the country in February.
