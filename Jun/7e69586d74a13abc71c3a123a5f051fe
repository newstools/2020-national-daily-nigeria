Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki has formally announced his decision to resign his membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress.
He made decision after meeting President Muhammadu Buhari at Aso Rock onMnday, days after the party’s NWC disqualified him from contesting the party primary in the run up to the September guber election.
The PDP had rallied round at the national level, but the state chapter of the party insists there is no automatic ticket for him. The party already screened its three contestants.
Besides, the reason he was disqualified from the APC race won’t just go away. It was the PDP that first levelled the certificate forgery allegation against Obaseki in 2016. Though it was never proven as the court thought otherwise.
Some Oshiomhole-led APC loyalists believes that it could become a stronger weapon now that his disqualification is on this ground, particularly as it affects the documents, the affidavit, and other alleged inconsistencies the party highlighted.
