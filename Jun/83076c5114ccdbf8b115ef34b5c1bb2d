The Thursday NEC meeting was a council of war of sorts. And it was not only the suspended Chairman Adams Oshiomhole that went down in the strategy adopted; the NEC convener and self-appointed national chairman Victor Giadom was also a casualty.
According to the Nation, Giadom left the meeting in a huff thanks to Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila who dealt him a haymaker.
The former deputy national secretary carried his luck too far when he made to talk after the NWC was dissolved. But Gbajabiamila was said to have cut him short, saying Giadom had no say since the NWC had been dissolved and he was no longer part of NEC.
The Speaker’s objection was upheld.
With that bit properly stuck in his mouth, Giadom was dumb throughout the meeting, until he stormed out. Buhari, his major supporter before the meeting, couldn’t help him.
The Oshiomhole-led NWC was dissolved at the meeting, but the committee member are spoiling for legal battle with NEC—and its leader Buhari.
