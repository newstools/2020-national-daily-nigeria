Because Fulani owns Nigeria and has been ruling the country, no sate o tribe can stop Fulani herdsmen from exercising rights to secure themselves anywhere in the country, a Fulani herdsmen association has stated..
According to Bello Abdullahi Bodejo, the National President of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, the herdsmen group will soon float a 5,000-strong security outfit similar to Amotekun and others.
Abdullahi also revealed that his organisation had concluded arrangements to flag-off its own security outfit with about 5,000 to 100,000 vigilantes to be deployed across all the states of the country.
“While their own is Amotekun, our own name shall be unveiled soon. We have not decided on its name, maybe, it may be called, Miyetti Allah Vigilante,” he said in an interview with the Sun.
“We are meeting, anytime from now, we make our plans public. We will first start with 5,000 personnel,” he said, adding that, “It is going to be across the country because there is no any angle you cannot find the Fulani in this country.”
He said that even though personnel of this security outfit are meant to tackle rustlers and bandits with guns and other weapons, they (the new security outfit) will not bear arms but will use the same sticks they use to control cows.
“It is not against the law in this country. Who would they go to take permission from, is it the animals in the bush?”
Abdullahi said that no one can drive away the Fulani.
“They produced the first prime minister. If they produced the first president, another president, another president and so on, are they not the owner of the country?
“Fulani are ruling Nigeria and they must continue to rule the country forever. That is the truth.”
