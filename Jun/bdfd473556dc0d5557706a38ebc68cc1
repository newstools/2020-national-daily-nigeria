The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated nearly $105 million in funding to over 300 healthcare providers to boost telehealth infrastructure as coronavirus outbreaks continue, per Fierce Healthcare.

We think that in order for telehealth to take off in underserved areas, more funding will need to be allocated to smaller, rural hospitals — rather than larger, well-funded health systems — to build up their telehealth platforms.

As virtual care flourishes for larger telehealth vendors and health systems, we expect telehealth adoption to remain high post-pandemic — and we think its ability to offer better doc-patient engagement will be a driving factor in sustaining uptake.

Telehealth use continues to skyrocket amid the pandemic, and we don’t expect adoption rates to fall back down to pre-coronavirus levels once outbreaks subside. We think this will be driven in part by the fact that patients will get accustomed to the convenience telehealth affords, and they won’t want to trade that in post-pandemic
