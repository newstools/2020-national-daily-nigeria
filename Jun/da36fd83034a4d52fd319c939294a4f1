Governor Godwin Obaseki on Friday said he and his team wish Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), well in his maladministration of the APC; adding that he will not appeal his disqualification for the primary election of the party for the September 2020 governorship election in Edo State  by the screening committee.
The governor in a statement by his media aide to the governor, Crusoe Osagie, said that he watched the mockery of the democratic process, which “Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, is administering and superintending” over the All Progressives Congress (APC). He was of the view that the screening   was an unfortunate, disheartening, and dreadful spectacle.
Governor Obaseki expressed his earlier reservations  that considering the open display and enthronement of illegality by one man in the party that comprises several organs and eminent personalities, it was obvious that he would get a fair assessment in the build up to the primary election for the nomination of the APC candidate for  the Edo gubernatorial election.
Obaseki decried that it is unfortunate this “open show of shame, illegality, and travesty of justice is the brand of democracy which Comrade Oshiomhole has reduced the APC into”. He noted that the party has lost its repute for change, equity and social justice.
“We have, therefore, decided that it would be an effort in futility to appeal whatever the unjust outcome of the evaluation and screening process of the APC will be, especially when Comrade Oshiomhole has declared that he is the Supreme Court and ultimate determiner of the fate and future of our great party.
“We wish Oshiomhole well in his maladministration of the party and trust that the Almighty will help our country to find the path to true liberty, freedom, and justice,” Governor Obaseki declared.
The governor urged all APC party members and his teeming supporters in Edo State to remain calm and wait for directives.
