The late ex-Gov Abiola Ajimobi eventually tested negative to Covid-19 he battled with for weeks, but the complications developed in the course of the battle took his life.
Ajimobi was admitted to First Cardiologist and Cardio-vascular Consultants Hospital in Lagos where he underwent series of management, including a lung surgery.
But according to the Lagos Covid-19 Management Task Force, Ajimobi died following multiple organ failures caused by the infection.
“We regret the death of the immediate past Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajumobi who passed on today, June 25, 2020 at First Cardiologist Consultant; a private COVID-19 approved care facility in Lagos State,” Lagos Health Commissioner Akinwunmi Abayomi tweeted on Friday.
The late APC southwest national vice chairman died at 70.
