An Igbo man from Abia State, Nigeria, David Ndudim, recently grabbed the appointment of a Judge in the United States Supreme Court.  Ndudim is a US-trained lawyer and has been in the service of the US judiciary over the years. He has shown outstanding performance in service delivery to be elevated to the present position in the United States of America.
The Nigerian Commission for Diaspora has since been celebrating the pride Ndudim has brought to Nigeria.
