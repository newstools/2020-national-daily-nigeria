Mercy during a recent Instagram Live with Omashola made a gesture insinuating body odour instead of mentioning a name which many have taken as a shade to Tacha.

The drama between last season winner of the BBNaija reality show, Mercy Eke and a former female housemate who got disqualified before the end of the show, Tacha, doesn’t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon.

Even with the ongoing BBNaija Pepper Dem reunion, housemates haven’t stopped throwing shades at each other.

For Mercy and Tacha, the fight had been going on since the show which escalated to a physical fight that ended up getting Tacha disqualified, is still on-going.

During the fight, the two could be heard body shaming and slut shaming each other while Mercy kept accusing Tacha of having a body odour, telling her she stinks.

Those words stuck as many began aligning everything about the disqualified housemate to body odour.

In a recent Instalive session with Omashola, Mercy could be seen raising her ampit, smelling it as a hint about somebody which many believes is Tacha while they both laugh after apparently getting what is being communicated.
