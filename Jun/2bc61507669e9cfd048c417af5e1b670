Heads of all tertiary institutions in the country have agreed on a minimum score of 160 for 2020/2021 admissions, while Polytechnics adopted 120 and Colleges of Education agreed on a minimum score of 100.
Speaking during the 2020 policy meeting on admissions, Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, said no institution is allowed to go below the minimum score pegged for admission.
Based on the guidelines released by JAMB during the meeting, 2020 admissions for the first choice are expected to commence in August.
He said: “The minimum score as decided at the meeting for universities will be 160, for polytechnics will be 120 and for colleges of education will be 100. That does not mean that it is to be accepted and we have seen what each institution has decided.
”For the polytechnics and colleges of education, it is also as decided by each of the institutions except that no institution would be allowed to admit a candidate for universities if you have scored less than 160 in UTME but that is not the only thing that will be taken for admission.
“Nobody can admit a candidate with a score less than what the institution prescribed, that’s, those who set 210 can be 210, not 209. Those who set 200 is 200 but nobody is allowed to go below 160 for universities.”
