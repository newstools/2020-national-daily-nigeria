She also noted that Uti threaded carefully, and he never contacted her with his actual number as she shared screenshots of their chats.
“As at 2017, Uti and I were casual friend. I was an apprentice in a men’s cloth shop then and that was where we met. I knew from day one that Uti was very hot tempered and should never go close to sharp objects when angered
“He had a girl back them, Angela. She was pretty and melanin too. He came around with her most times and my co-workers and I really loved her cos she was nice. Such that when Uti made his first advance at me, I waved him off
“But I had my reservations. He tried convincing me to visit him, but I told him I don’t want your girl to break my head. The common female slang then. He then asked to come to my house. I was sharing an apartment with one of my female friends.
“He made advances at me. Told me I was prettiest girl he knew and that he was obsessed with me. I told him we could talk this out. He fled up. In his words “I always get what I want’ and that was when he forced himself on me.”
She described Uti as a violent and forceful person by nature “what he did to me however, took me by surprise. As he always smiled at me like he meant well.
