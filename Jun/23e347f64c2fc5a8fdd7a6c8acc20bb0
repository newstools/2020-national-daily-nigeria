The University of Ibadan has confirmed the authenticity of the certificate of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state, stating that he graduated with Second Class Honours (Lower Division) in 1979.
In a statement by the University’s Registrar, Mrs. Olubunmi Faluyi, records of Obaseki’s admission shows that he gained admission in 1976 and graduated in 1979 in Classics.
It would be recalled that Obaseki was dragged to a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, accused of certificate forgery and perjury by Edobor Williams, Ugbesia Abudu Godwin and Amedu Dauda Anakhu.
The case was filed on 29 May.
Governor Obaseki has however, dismissed the allegations of certificate fraud as baseless, unfounded, and diversionary, calling those raising eyebrows over his academic qualifications, as mischievous.
He has been in a running battle with his predecessor Adams Oshiomhole over the second term ticket. The latter, who is the National Chairman of the APC, has vowed to ensure the governor does not get a second term in office.
Meanwhile, the governor attended the screening of the aspirants for the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket in Edo.
The screening of the six aspirants for the ruling party began on Wednesday afternoon at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja.
According to reports, Governor Godwin Obaseki arrived at about 1:10 and left after five minutes.
However, the chairman of the screening committee, Prof. Jonathan Ayuba, said it was only to verify all the documents provided by the aspirants and make recommendations to the party based on its findings.
