Until now, not much was heard about the probe of Imo ex-Gov Rochas Okorocha’s looting of the state. The reason is that more—at least N5bn—than the amount currently recovered—N2.7bn is still stashed about in accounts which he and his fronts own.
As soon as more could be recovered and investigation concluded, the EFCC said it will begin the prosecution of the former APC governor now a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
“Out of the N2.7bn already returned to Imo State, the immediate past governor of the state, Emeka Ihedioha, received N2.5bn, while Hope Uzodinma received N514m in May,” said the commission Port Harcourt Zonal Head Imam Usman.
“Also, properties worth billions of naira recovered in the course of the investigation have been forfeited to the federal government.”
Before he fell out of grace with Aso Rock, Okorocha was the APC governors forum chairman and one of those many thought had the ears of President Muhammadu Buhari.
He began his journey downwards when he moved to install his son-in-law Uche Nwosu as his successor.
