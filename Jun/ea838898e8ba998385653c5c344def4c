Barely few days after the Lagos state government kicked against reopening of churches and mosques in the state due to disagreements on protocols and guidelines between the state government and the religious leaders, it has finally fixed June 19, 2020 as the new date for re-opening of worship centres.
It would be recalled that the federal government had on Monday, June 1 lifted the ban on mosques and churches in the country.
But Lagos state had given reasons why worship centres across the state could not be opened until certain guidelines are met by religious leaders in the state.
However, at a media briefing on June 4, governor of the state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said his government will allow a restricted opening of religious houses based on compliance reviewed with the state’s safety commission.
The governor said mosques are allowed to reopen on June 19, while churches are allowed to reopen on June 21.
Noting that mass gatherings can increase the spread of the coronavirus, Sanwo-Olu said churches and mosques can only reopen at a maximum of 40 per cent of their capacity.
“Even if your 40 per cent capacity is really so large, you cannot have beyond 500 (people), and keeping the maximum capacity is really important,” he said.
