No fewer than 20 Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters were killed by the troops of Sector 3  and  Air Task Force Operation Lafiya Dole at Monguno, Borno on Saturday.
The soldiers were said to have also destroyed four gun trucks the insurgents brought.
The troops also captured some of the terrorists and their equipment.
The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, commended the troops in a statement on Sunday.
“The high command of the Armed Forces of Nigeria commends the land component and  Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole for the dexterity and professionalism exhibited during this operation,” he said on Sunday in a statement.
“The troops are further encouraged to remain resolute and decisive in their ground and air offensives in the theatre.”
The terrorists have besieged Borno lately killing scores of people in two separate attacks last week shortly after COAS Tukur Buratai told President Muhammadu Buhari the federal troops were making headway in the counterinsurgency ops.
