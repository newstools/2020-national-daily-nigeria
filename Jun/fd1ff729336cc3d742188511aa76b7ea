The Speaker of Lagos House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. (Dr.) Mudashiru Ajayi Obasa, and members of the Assembly paid a condolence visit to the immediate family of late Bayo Osinowo at their Molipa, Ijebu-Ode residence, today, Sunday, June 21, 2020.
Late Bayo Osinowo, who died on Monday, June 15, 2020, after a brief illness, was a member of Lagos House of Assembly for 16 consecutive years before moving to the senate.
Speaking with the family, Obasa extolled the sterling qualities and contributions of late Osinowo to the growth of the Lagos House of Assembly in his 16 years as a member.
He prayed to Almighty Allah to forgive him all his sins and grant him aljannah firdaus.
The Speaker said the family should take solace in the fact that the late senator was loved by many because of his benevolence and sacrifice.
He also informed the family that the House of Assembly will be holding a special parliamentary session in honour of Senator Osinowo on Tuesday, June 23, 2020.
He urged the family to choose a representative that would speak on behalf of the family at the session.
Dr. Tunde Osinowo, the first son of the deceased, who spoke on behalf of the family, thanked Obasa and the members for the visit to the family.
Dr. Osinowo said their father had prepared them for his demise through his talks and deeds while he was alive but that it was hard for them to cope with the reality of his sudden death.
The Speaker and the members thereafter prayed for the deceased, who until his death, was the Senator representing Lagos East.
