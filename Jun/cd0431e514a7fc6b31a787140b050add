As seconds tick in the countdown to the Edo PDP primary contest June 25, Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki has recorded more victories in his struggle to clinch the party ticket: two of his rivals have stepped down now, including the litigant Omorege Ogbeide-Ihama who sought to obtain a restraining order against Obaseki on Tuesday.
Ogbeide-Ihama, through his lawyer at the resumed hearing in a Port Harcourt federal high court, Wednesday morning, said he and the defendant are ready to settle the matter out of court.
His truce with Obaseki followed Gideon Ikhine’s which came after the governor was cleared on Saturday to contest.
Political observers had predicted the end of Obaseki’s move when Rivers Gov. Nyesome Wike pulled out of the Obaseki-re-election project because the Edo governor dismissed his advice to carry along the state party leaders and other PDP governors in the south-south.
Wike isn’t just the loudest mouth amongst the PDP governor; he is a force to reckon with in most of the party’s decision-making efforts at both state and national levels.
