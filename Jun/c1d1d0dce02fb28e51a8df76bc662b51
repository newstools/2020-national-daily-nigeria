The remaining governorship aspirant for the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Kenneth Imasuagbon, has stepped down for Governor Godwin Obaseki in the primary election scheduled for Thursday in Edo State. Imasuagbon was the last to step down for Obaseki after rigorous negotiations and horse trading to ensure the emergence of Obaseki as PDP governorship candidate and at the same time cohesion and unity of the party in the build up to the September governorship election in Edo State.
Gideon Ikhine was the first aspirant to step down for Governor Godwin Obaseki. Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama stepped down on Thursday some hours to the commencement of the primaries on Edo State.
Imasuagbon withdrawal from the race now leaves Obaseki as PDP consensus candidate.
The September 19 governorship election in Edo State   is clearly between Obaseki of the PDP and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
