The Police command in Ibadan has arrested one Ayokunbi Olaniyi, 22, after he was caught allegedly having sex with a pig.
Olaniyi, who resides in Eleti – Odo area, Iwo Road, Ibadan, was on Tuesday arraigned in an Iyaganku Chief Magistrates’ Court and charged with one count of unnatural offense.
The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Opeyemi Olagunju told the court that on April 2, at about 4 p.m at Elewi–Odo , Ibadan, the defendant allegedly had sex with a pig against order of nature.
Olagunju alleged that the defendant worked for Mrs Adenike Taiwo’s pig farm in Elewi – Odo area of Ibadan.
According to him, the offence contravened the provisions of Section 214 (2) of the Criminal Code Cap 38, Vol. II , Laws of Oyo State 2000.
However, the Defence Counsel, Mr Mumin Jimoh, prayed the court to grant his client bail in the most liberal terms after he pleaded “not guilty” to the crime.
Jimoh said the owner of the pig has forgiven the defendant.
The Chief Magistrate Olaide Amzat in his ruling said the law must take its cause.
“If the owner has forgiven the defendant, has God forgiven him or the pig forgiven him?
“The defendant will be given a bail in the sum of N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum,” he added.
He adjourned the matter until July 21, for hearing, NAN reports
