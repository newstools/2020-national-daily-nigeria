One of Nigeria’s leading retail bank, WEMA Bank, on Thursday said COVID-19 infection has hit two of its branches nationwide, and that the infected staff are currently being treated after only displaying mild symptoms.
In a terse statement seen by National Daily on Thursday, the bank said “In keeping with our commitment to ensure the safety of our customers, staff and community, we have notified customers who visited those branches to get tested.
“In light of this, both branches have been shut down for immediate disinfection and will only be reopened once we certify that it is safe enough for services to resume.
“Customers in the affected areas can continue to carry out transactions using our alternative banking channels – ALAT and *945#. Should you have any issues, you can call our customer service or visit any of our other branches close to you.
“We implore everyone to keep up good hygiene practices; do not discriminate or stigmatize infected persons and desist from spreading false information, the statement concluded.
