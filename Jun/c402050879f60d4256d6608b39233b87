PDP guber candidate and Edo Gov. Godwin Obaseki hasn’t won the suit filed against him weeks ago by some APC members. He merely had the evil day postponed.
The case, suit No FHC/ABJ/CS /553/20 Edobor Williams and others VS APC & Obaseki, was dismissed June 29 when the plaintiffs and their counsel refused to show up for hearing.
Obaseki’s supporters have ticked this up as a victory over the APC and its former national chairman Adams Oshiomhole, and his candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
But the APC members, Edooboer Williams and others, through their lawyers, explained that it was a strategy.
In a statement on Tuesday by Shores and Savana, the legal representatives to Edobor Williams and others, the plantiffs said they were opposed to APC nominating Godwin Obaseki as its gubernatorial candidate for the September 19, governorship election because of his inconsistent educational history, false credentials and forged Affidavit.
But since Obaseki was disqualified because of the shady credentials, the plaintiffs voluntarily filed a Notice of Discontinuance of the said suit.
‘’The public must take notice that the case was never considered on merit,” said Williams and others.
“Plaintiffs would take further steps after the nominations of all the parties are concluded and the names of their candidates submitted to INEC.”
The electoral act allows INEC to accept whatever certificate candidates present. It’s the duty of the public and rivals to contest the originality and tenability of such credentials and their owners in court.
The Edo APC, particularly its aggrieved leader,  is thus marking its time.
Oshiomhole got into problem that saw him out of office because of his long-drawn-out battle with his godson Obaseki, among other issues.
And it appears the end is not in sight yet to the war even as the governor defected to the PDP to seek re-election.
