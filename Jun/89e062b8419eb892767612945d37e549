President Muhammadu Buhari’s claim—that that he consulted well, and was damn sure the law is on the side of Victor Giadom—has been described as mischievous by another associate the No 1 citizen leans on.
Aso Rock normally drops no name when the president makes such claim. But the foremost legal adviser to the administration and custodian of Buhari’s legal enlightenment is AGF/Justice Dan Malami. And Nigerians know him and his antecedents.
The citizens equally know Prof. Itse Sagay as a brook-no-shit, go-to guy of the administration when it comes to anti-corruption legal advice.
So many won’t be surprised to hear Sagay give a piece of his mind on the Giadom epic.
According to the constitutional law professor, Buhari has no business attending the NEC meeting the self-appointed chairman called.  .
“I’m stunned by this turn of events,” he told the Nation.
“The legal advice the President got is mischievous in the extreme because there is no court order to extend since it does not exist,”  said the chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Anti-Corruption.
He wondered how a deputy national secretary could have the ambition to be the chairman of a party when there are deputy chairmen and vice-chairmen?”
He  added that it is absurd.
“His position makes it impossible for him to be the acting national chairman.”
Buhari has,  however, promised to grace the absurdity.
