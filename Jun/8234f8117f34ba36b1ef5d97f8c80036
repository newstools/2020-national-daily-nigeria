Following the defection of Edo Gov. Godwin Obaseki from the APC to the PDP, the APC executive committee at the Etsako 10 ward level, where the national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was suspended, has made a u-turn.
It voided the suspension on Saturday.
At a press conference in Abuja, Emuakemeh Sule, Secretary of the ward, said 17 members out of 26 signed the resolution.
Oshiomhole was suspended last November in the heat of his battle with Obaseki, and his failure—and that of the APC—to address it plunged the party into a crisis lately.
A federal high court knocked Oshiomhole off his perch as a result of that, and an ex-deputy national secretary gave the party a headache by snatching the seat.
Although the two gladiators wrestled each other out of the ring for a couple of days, each in two different parties will be joining battle again as the state guber election comes up Sept 22.
The APC chairman of the ward, Etsako West, that suspended Oshiomhole in favour of Obaseki have backed off the governor.
Mrs Rabiat Ezolomhe said that she and her members still remain in the party.
