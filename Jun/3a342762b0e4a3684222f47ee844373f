The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Edo state chapter, says it will investigate Governors Godwin Obaseki’s certificates, it however described his disqualification by the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a clear case of ‘vindictiveness of the highest order.’
Anthony Aziegbemi, Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, stated this while reacting to the circumstances that lead to the defection of Obaseki from the All Progressives Congress.
Obaseki, who joined the PDP on Friday, left the APC after he was disqualified by the committees inaugurated by the National Chairman of the party and his political adversary, Adams Oshiomhole.
According to the APC committees, Obaseki was disqualified over multiple inconsistencies in his presented academic certificates, including a Higher School Leaving Certificate the Governor claimed to have obtained from an Institute of Continuing Education in Benin City, Edo State.
Reacting on Saturday, Aziegbemi described the APC screening as a sham, “It was a clear case of ‘vindictiveness of the highest order’ and there was no need for it to happen in the first instance. The PDP will set up a very powerful team to look at those papers. I suspect that the screening process of the other party (APC) was more of vindictiveness. They were not fair to him, but we will not do that. We will be transparent and investigative.”
However, the PDP postponed its primaries from June 23 to 25 to accommodate the verification process and other activities.
