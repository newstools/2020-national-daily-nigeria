Police stationed at the APC national headquarters office in Abuja have barred the party’s National Secretary Waziri Bulama and others from entering the premises on Thursday—the day the Victor Giadom one-man NWC called for a NEC meeting with Buhari in attendance inside Aso Rock.
Bulama arrived at the secretariat about 10:50 am in his car, and was stopped at the gate by armed policemen on duty.
“I came here this morning to resume work and met policemen who said they have instructions from above to seal the secretariat,’ Bulama told newsmen.
He said he called the commissioner of police and he said he is sending a senior officer to see what is happening.
“The workers of the secretariat are servicing over 16 million members of this party across Nigeria. They are like civil servants.”
This is the first confrontation and counter-manoeuver on the day the party’s NEC is supposed to meet and dissolve the crisis-ridden NWC led by Abiola Ajimobi after national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was suspended by court orders.
