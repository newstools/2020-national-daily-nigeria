Karma has fallen on the embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, as the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Tuesday upheld his suspension as APC member and chairman. By the Appeal Court judgement.
The Appeal Court delivering judgment on the interlocutory appeal filed by Oshiomhole, affirmed the judgment of the Federal Capital Territory High Court delivered by the presiding judge, Justice Danlami Senchi, in March who ordered the suspension of Oshiomhole as well as restraining him from parading himself as APC National Chairman.
It was gathered that in a unanimous judgement in the first appeal delivered by Justice Eunice Onyemanam, the court held that the FCT High Court had territorial jurisdiction to have entertained the suit as it did.
The Appeal Curt also withdrew his rights and privileges as APC National Chairman, including his security details.
The appeal court anchored its judgement on the argument that Oshiomole as the first appellant is resident in Abuja while the APC also has its national headquarters in the FCT.
In the judgment on the second appeal delivered by Justice Mohammed Lamido, the court disagreed with Oshiomhole that their right to a fair hearing was breached by the trial court.
Justice Lamido further said that there was no basis for the two appellants to hold that they were denied fair hearing during proceedings at the FCT High Court.
It further held that the suspension of  Oshiomole from Ward 10 of Etsako Local Government of Edo state was ratified at the ward, local and state government level as required by law.
The court maintained: “And the identity of those who suspended him was not in doubt because in their unchallenged affidavit they made it clear that they were party members and officers of the party, therefore, the appeal lacks merit.”
Oshiomhole and the APC are the appellants in the two dismissed appeals.
