Eighteen suspected kidnappers were struck dead by thunder inside a forest in Adamawa where they were sharing their ransoms.
The incident occurred within the Toungo Local Government Area of the state, local sources said.
“The bandits had collected over N20 million from their wealthy victims between Koncha in Cameroon and Toungo in Nigeria,” a source in Toungo said.
The source said community leaders and victims consulted with a native doctor who attacked the kidnappers with thunder.
Local hunters could not retrieve their corpses nor their money inside some bags as well as their weapons.
The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said Friday morning that the incident actually happened within Cameroon soil near the border with Nigeria.
“We heard that the victims engaged the services of a native doctor, but it was said to have occurred in the neighbouring Cameroon, which is not under our jurisdiction,” Nguroje said.
