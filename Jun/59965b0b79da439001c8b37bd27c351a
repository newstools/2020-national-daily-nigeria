The Amotekun Corps, a regional security architecture in southwest Nigeria has sent a strong warning to the Fulani herdsmen who have been destroying farmlands and threatening the security of rural communities, including the umbrella organization, the Miyetti Allah, that it is no longer business as usual.  The Amotekun Corps that constitutes the Ondo State Security Network Agency, arrested 42 cows which were wrongly guarded to destroy farmlands at Alagbaka extension in Akure.
The Ondo State Commander of the Amotekun Corps, Adetunji Adeleye, said the Corps arrested the cows after receiving five consecutive complaints from owners of the farmlands being invaded by the herdsmen and their flock.
Adeleye stated the herds trampled on eight farmlands and completely destroyed crops which include maize and cassava under the supervision of Fulani herdsmen, who were acknowledged to often graze their cattle within the environment.
The Commander narrated that the herdsmen who were heavily armed pursued the farm owners, who escaped to inform the Amotekun Corps. He said that the heavily armed herdsmen had attempted to kill the farm owners immediately they invaded the farmlands with their cattle. The farmers, however, fled for their safety before alerting the Amotekun who urgently intervened, arresting the cows in the process.
However, the Ondo State Commander did not give details of further actions or how the arrested cattle would be released.
At the time of this report, the leadership of the Miyetti Allah is yet to react to the incident.
