Buhari orders investigation into State House shooting President Muhammadu Buhari ordered “proper investigation” into State House shooting on June 12, 2020.

The state house was in turmoil Tuesday as President Muhammadu Buhari reassigns his security details and some top aides for the roles they all played in dragging the Presidency into the mud.

Trouble started over the weekend when Mr. Sabiu Yusuf, a.k.a. “Tunde”, a nephew and influential Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, escaped a brutal attack from the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari and her children — Zahra, Halima and Yusuf and shots were fired at him.

ElombahNews learnt the mayhem was over Yusuf’s refusal to embark on a 14-day isolation period after returning to Abuja from a trip to Lagos last week.

The Aide De Camp to Mrs Buhari and other security details attached to her were arrested on the orders of the IGP.

They were later released and reassigned after it was claimed that they threatened to kill the President’s Personal Assistant in the process of trying to get him out of the Villa.

President Buhari, who was deeply angered by the embarrassing situation, Tuesday fired his security details and some top aides for the roles they all played in dragging the Presidency into the fracas.

According to reports, those sacked and/or reassigned included Buhari’s Chief Security Officer, Kassim Idrissa, his ADC, Col. Mohammed Lawal Abubakar, his Chief Personal Secuirty Officer, Abdulkareem Dauda, whom Yusuf, a son to Buhari’s niece, claimed to be threats to his life.

Nigerians have generally criticised Buhari for keeping mute since the outrage became public knowledge.
