National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has trashed the viral rumour that a cold war is raging between him and his protege, Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior.
The rumour started after the Governor’s Advisory Council in the state announced the ban of political groups within APC in the state, including Aregbosola’s Mandate Group, believed to be one of the groups affected by the directives.
But Tinubu has emphatically denied the speculation and accused the author of groundless speculation.
“There is no war, cold or hot, between them. There has never been and there will never be. Asiwaju believes in him and he believes in the APC leader”, said a statement on Tinubu’s Twitter handle.
“Our attention has been drawn to a report in an online newspaper alleging that the GAC’s appropriate and candid resolution had worsened a phantom cold war between Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.
“This is a figment of the imagination of the news organization that authored the report. Asiwaju Tinubu remains Ogbeni Aregbesola’s leader. The former governor of Osun State has been unswervingly & wholly committed to the progressive ideology of the Tinubu political family.
The statement added that there was no war, cold or hot, between Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.
“Our political family remains strong. And we are staying focused in our commitment to building and maintaining a cohesive political party.”
The statement stated that the resolution of GAC was to restate the often-stated position that the only group known to us is APC and not any of the factional groups. It was to renew the commitment to APC and its unity.
“Ogbeni Aregbesola is a strong member of the political family. The GAC position does not imply any division within the group. The resolution is well-meaning and should not be misinterpreted,” the statement added.
