Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly Service Commission (LAHASCOM) led by their Chairman Chief Wale Mogaji paid a  condolence visit to the family of the Late Senator Bayo Osinowo (Pepperito) at their Ijebu Ode residence.

Addressing the wife of the late Senator, Alhaja Mariam Osinowo and other members of the family, Mogaji commiserated with the deceased family, Mogaji said Osinowo would be greatly missed.

Mogaji said:”He was a great political ally and one who wanted the best for the State and Nation.

“He is a pillar of support to the Commission, philanthropist, leader of leaders and a political juggernaut.

“The entire LAHASCOM grieves with your family and pray that God will accept your soul into Al-jaanah Firdaus,” he said.

A short prayer was rendered by a Member of the Commission, Dr Bode Tawak, who urged his wife to accept the will of Allah and find solace in the fact that he lived an impactful  life.

“He was always willing to help; at least eight, out of ten people who came to him for assistance, would smile back home. That was pepper,” Tawak stated.

Other members of the Commission on the entourage were Otunba Richard Oshungboye and Hon. Akeem Bello.
