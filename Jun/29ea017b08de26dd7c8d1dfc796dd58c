There are unconfirmed reports that the APC southwest vice chairman and ex-Gov Abiola Ajimobi is dead.
The rumour might have sprung out of the last heard about the 70-year-old who came down with Covid-19 days ago, and was admitted into a private hospital in Lagos.
But Babajide  Kola-Otitoju, a veteran journalist and news manager at TVC news, posted on his Facebook account something of a confirmation.
“Good night, Isiak Abiola Ajimobi. I asked for prayers for you but God loves you more,” wrote Kola-Otitoju.

The National Daily reached out to sources to confirm this. None could actually establish the truth of the news because no family members of the governor responded to calls.
The first blog that published  the rumour, www.aledeh.com,  was taken down within minutes. Following that, www.citynewsng.com published another piece dismissing the news, quoting Ajimobi’s aide.
A tweet from theex-governor’s daughter-in-law also dismissed Kola-Otitoju’s farewell.
“Thank you for all the messages. But our father is still alive,” tweeted Fatima Ganduje-Ajimobi Thursday night
Ajimobi was appointed acting chairman of the APC after the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole yesterday.
