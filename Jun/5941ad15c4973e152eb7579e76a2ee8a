The son of former Nigeria’s Head of State, late Gen. Sanni Abacha, Sadiq Abacha has revealed that his father kept looted funds abroad for a reason.
Sani Abacha came into power in 1993 and ruled Nigeria with an iron grip until his death in 1998. Activists who criticized his regime were imprisoned for months, with some put to death. Opposition leaders were jailed under his leadership.
The former president, who lived a lavish lifestyle, is reported to have stolen over $4 billion during his five years in office through his family and allies.
In 2017, the Swiss government reclaimed funds of $321 million from Abacha’s family and has recovered around $700 million of Abacha-related assets to date.
However, Sadiq in an interview with the BBC Hausa Service on Wednesday, did not revealed the reasons, but he emphatically said it was done for reason.
He also spoke on how Abacha family members feel about discoveries and recoveries of their father’s loot as well as their relationship with Nigerians especially, the late father’s friends.
On how Abacha family members are being treated, Sadiq claimed that despite late President Musa Yar’Adua lifting the travel ban placed on their family, that he and other family members were still being harassed whenever they travel in and out of the country.
On those the family relate well with, Sadiq said, “Our present relationship with some of our late father’s friends is surprising. We exchange pleasantries with the family of General Babangida. We are in good terms.
“It is only with members of the Babangida family that whenever we meet, we associate and share stories. We also relate well with family members of President Muhammadu Buhari. But it’s only with the Babangida’s that we recall the past.”
