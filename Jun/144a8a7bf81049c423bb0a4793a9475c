All things being equal, the likely acting leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) May have resolved to reject the resignation of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, including the Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, who announced their exit from the party on Tuesday. The party is also likely to nullify the decision of the screening committee that disqualified Governor Obaseki from participating in the APC primary election for the nomination of candidate for the September governorship election in Edo State.
But whether this decisions will make Obaseki return to the party remains to be seen. The party experienced a turn of events when the Court of Appeal upheld the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole as national chairman of the APC. The judgment bars Oshiomhole from parading himself as both APC member and national chairman.
The emergent Acting National Chairman of the APC, Lawal Shaibu, who is APC Deputy National Chairman, North, put a seal on the turn of events in the party; he declared: “I will resume office as the Acting National Chairman of my party as soon as I receive the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Obaseki’s resignation will be rejected by our party. A sitting governor is an asset to our great party.”
Time ran out on Oshiomhole when he lost the appeal, he filed for interlocutory injunction to revert the judgement of the FCT High Court which legalized his suspension from APC by his ward in Edo State.
