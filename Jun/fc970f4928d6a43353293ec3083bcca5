The rate of infection of the Coronavirus has continued to grow in Oyo state as Governor Seyi Makinde, on Wednesday announced that three members of the state executive council have tested positive for COVID-19.
The state is currently ranked fourth on the number of cases in the country with 1,055 cases, 291 discharged cases and nine cases of deaths resulting from the pandemic.
In his official verified Twitter handle, Governor Seyi Makinde added that the results of two other members came back inconclusive and would be retested.
Makinde affirmed that the affected members had been contacted, while contact tracing had commenced and their offices closed for decontamination.
“Earlier today, we received COVID-19 confirmation tests for all members of the Oyo State Executive Council (EXCO). Sadly, three tests came back positive, and two were inconclusive so they will need to be retested.”
“COVID-19 is still very much with us. That we are taking steps to re-open the economy does not mean that the virus has disappeared. We must each take actions to protect ourselves and our families.
“Sometimes, even after following all directives, we may still get the virus. When this happens, we need to have our bodies ready to fight the disease,” Makinde tweeted.
He urged the people of the state to join in prayer for those who had contracted coronavirus and wished them a speedy recovery.
Residents of the state with any symptoms of COVID-19 are to visit any community-based testing centre near them or call any of the emergency operation centre’s numbers.
