Residents at 11 estates in south Beijing’s Fengtai district have been ordered to stay at home, following the emergence of a coronavirus outbreak at Beijing’s largest seafood and produce market.
The outbreak, which comes more than 50 days after the last local case of Covid-19 was recorded in the city of 20 million, has infected at least 53 people.
According to the Beijing health commission, nearly everyone who tested positive had worked or shopped at the Xinfadi market.
The Xinfadi market has been closed by authorities as they race to contain the cluster, which emerged more than 50 days after the last local case of Covid-19 was recorded in the city of 20 million, fueling fears of a resurgence in local transmission – and concern China’s grip on the pandemic is not yet secure.
At least 53 people have been linked to the market, which provides much of the capital’s food supply, the Beijing health commission said.
Nearly everyone who tested positive had worked or shopped at the market, which employs upwards of 10,000 people. The virus was reportedly detected on cutting boards for imported salmon there.
Officials in Fengtai, home to more than two million people, announced on Saturday the district had established a “wartime mechanism” to deal with the fresh wave.
