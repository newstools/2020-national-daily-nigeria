The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has approved the issuance of new certificate of national service to Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State to correct the error of omission of a letter in his name Obasek(i) where I was omitted.
The new NYSC certificate though bears the date 19thÂ June 2020, it reflected the service year august 1979 to august 1980. The issuance of a new NYSC put to rest the controversy of certificate inconsistency.
Governor Obaseki has been improving on his aspiration for re-election for second term as Governor of Edo State since his defection to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after his illegal disqualification by the APC screening committee because of the certificate controversy.
