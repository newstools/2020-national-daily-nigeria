The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, may be facing fresh trouble in combating the Boko Haram terrorists in northeast Nigeria. In less than one week the CoS at the State House, Abuja, where he briefed President Muhammadu Buahri on military operations in the northeast, saying that over 1400 Boko Haram terrorists have been killed in the operations, Boko Haram terrorists were    reported to have struck, killing about 69 people in Gubio Community, Borno State.
It was indicated that Gubio is located 96 kilometres from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State. The terrorists were said to have invaded the community in sudden force on Tuesday and operated for about two hours within which dead bodies were lithered on the streets of the community.  They were said to have in addition to human massacre killed over 300 cows; rustled about 1000 cows.
The terrorists may have compounded the successes the Chief of Army had claimed when he briefed the president at the State House, Abuja, last week. Apparently, the CoS may be contending with fresh trouble of confidence building in the president in the war against the Boko Haram terrorists.
