President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday ordered investigation into the shooting and attack on the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, by one of his Personal Assistants at the State House, Abuja, last Thursday.
The President in a statement in Sunday  acknowledged concerns expressed by several members of the public regarding what he considered the recent incident among the occupants of the State House which escalation led to the arrest of some staff by the police. This incident was the assault of the president’s wife and children by a Personal Assistant who subsequently ordered the arrest of the Aides to the president’s wife.
The president, however, shifted from the shooting incident to declare that he is not in any danger.
The statement from the presidency declared: “This is to assure all and everyone that the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Muhammadu Buhari, is not, and was not at any time in any form of danger arising, either from deadly infections or the reported incident by security personnel which is currently under investigation.
“This incident happened outside the main residence of the President.
“Armed guards and other security personnel assigned to the State House receive the necessary training of especially weapons handling and where they come short, their relevant agencies have their rules and regulations to immediately address them.
“Having authorized the proper investigation to be carried out into this unfortunate incident by the Police, the President has acted in compliance with the rule of law.”
The president decried that the a minor occurrence is being used by some critics to justify attacks on the government and the person of President Muhammadu Buhari beggars belief.
“In this particular instance, the President says the law should be allowed to take its course,” the statement read.
