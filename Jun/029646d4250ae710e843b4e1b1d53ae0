It was a recurrence of bloodbath when armed men suspected to be Fulani herdsmen in the early hours of Wednesdays invaded Tudun Doka community in Kajuru Local Government Area, Kaduna State, slaughtering many indigenes of the rural community. It was indicated that about 16 persons cannot be accounted for in the community after the slaughter.
Report indicated that nine people, especially, women and children, were killed with machetes by the herdsmen, as seven others were declared missing. An indigene was gathered to have narrated that “the herdsmen started attacking around 5.00am today, they hacked my daughter to death.”
The list of the people murdered by the invaders include Richard Yusuf, Kefas Yusuf, Fidelis Wada, Kachia, Genesis Soja, Victoria Gyata, Rose Soja and Rahab Soja; while seven other persons were said to be unaccounted for as they were neither found alive nor their corpses discovered after the carnage.

This is one of the serial attacks on Southern Kaduna that the federal government often do little to protect the lives of the people, particularly, so when such killings are linked to Fulani herdsmen since the Buhari administration.  Such invasion and slaughter of defenceless citizens by Fulani herdsmen took place May 19 to 24. Suspected herdsmen had struck at Idazau, Etissi, Bakin Kogi, Dutsen Gora, UN Gora, Pushu Kallah and Magunguna villages, killing several persons and burning several houses. These are beside several other attacks and killings in Southern Kaduna.
