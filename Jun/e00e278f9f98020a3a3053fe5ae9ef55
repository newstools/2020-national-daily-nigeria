Governor Nyesom Wike on Monday expressed his wish for the ruling All Progressives Congress following the leadership crisis which has nearly crippled the party.



Reacting to the crisis in the party, Governor Wike while appearing on Arise Television, said he prays that the ruling All Progressives Congress remains in crisis so that the Peoples’ Democratic Party can capitalize on that and bounce back.
The governor explained that he wants PDP to return to power, hence, we will continue to pray that APC remains in crisis.
He said, “I am happy that APC is in crisis. It is not my business to help APC to be united.
“Remember that we also had our own crisis under Ali Modu Sheriff and APC jubilated about it then. It is my prayer that they should continue to be in crisis. We have taken another state.
“Unfortunately, APC isn’t really a political party. They came together just to take over power. I want my party to be in power and therefore, I cannot be praying for APC not to have crisis. I hope they continue to make mistakes every day, and my party will continue to grow.”
Recall that the suspension of APC National Leader, Adams Oshiomhole by an Appeal Court had led to a leadership crisis in the party.
Following the crisis, the party’s National Executive Council, NEC, had dissolved its National Working Committee, NWC, led by Oshiomhole.
The party’s NEC immediately constituted a caretaker committee to ensure the smooth running of the party till its National convention.
APC’s NEC appointed the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, to head the Caretaker Committee.
During the meeting, President Muhammadu Buhari urged aggrieved members to suspend all court matters in the interest of the party.
