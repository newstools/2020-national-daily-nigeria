Former Senator representing Kaduna Central at the eight assembly, Shehu Sani has advised governors in the 36 states not to re-open schools at the moment following the rising cases of coronavirus in the country.
Sani who was reacting in a post on his Twitter page on Tuesday to plans by some state governors to reopen schools despite increasing COVID-19 cases in the country, advised states rushing to reopen schools to apply caution.
He said some governors who are contemplating reopening schools must also consider the health of students in congested public institutions before deciding to reopen schools across the federation.
The former lawmaker wrote: “States in a rush to reopen schools should seriously consider the lives of the multitude of children in congested public school.”
Sani further expressed disappointment over the continuous neglect of the use of face masks and social distancing by Nigerians despite the increasing number of cases recorded daily.
“It’s a fact today; many people have completely ignored face masks & social distancing since the lifting of the lockdown. No lessons learnt,” he added.
