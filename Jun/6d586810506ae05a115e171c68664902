The Red Devils under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have made clear their ambition to rebuild the Old Trafford club into a world class team. This idea is tied with their quest to return United to their glory days of which the Norwegian tactician was part of during his playing days.
Solskjaer who began with the rebuilding process at Old Trafford since his inception as United’s permanent manager in March, 2019 has not hidden his ambition to fortify United with further astonishing players to achieve his goal.
Report reaching National Daily can reveal that Manchester United who have been tipped to complete the transfer of England sensation Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund could face a wait until August.
The Red Devils’s idea for the latest development is to see the possibility of Dortmund lowering their audacious €130million (£117m) asking price.
National Daily further learnt that United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward who has previously spoken to dismiss claims he will meet Dortmund’s valuation of Sancho yesterday warned that their funds will be managed carefully.
“On the pitch, there is no escaping the reality that the coming months are going to be difficult for everyone in football and we are no exception,” said Woodward
“However, our club’s foundations are solid and, provided we stick together and manage our resources carefully, we will come through this period with our strength intact — thanks in large part to the loyalty of our fantastic supporters.”
Meanwhile, the report by BILD has suggested to National Daily that Sancho could finally head to the Old Trafford considering his ‘flirting’ with a return to England.
