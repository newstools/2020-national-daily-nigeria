The APC has insisted the partyâ€™s National Working Committee only ratified Abiola Ajimobi as the Acting National Chairman after Adams Oshiomhole was suspended by court.
It also disowned Victor Giadom, adding that his membership of the NWC ceased when he resigned to contest the deputy governorship position in Rivers.
The APC National Vice-Chairman (South-South), Hilliard Eta, who addressed the media soon after Giadom left the party Secretariat, said preparations for the Edo Governorship primary is on course.
