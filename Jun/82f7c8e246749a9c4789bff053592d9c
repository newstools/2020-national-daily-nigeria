It was a night of entertainment and competition when popular blog, Notjustok decided to bring us an edition of Kizz Daniel vs Tekno clash of hits.
The clash was hosted by Titilola with AfroVII representing Team Kizz Daniel (aka Vado) and OvieO representing Team Tekno. The clash lasted 10 rounds which saw Kizz Daniel winning 6 rounds out of 10 rounds. The Vaddicts(Kizz Daniel’s fans) really came through on this one.
Here are some reactions from the fans:
“Let’s be honest, this fvck u song by kizz Daniel, brought out artistes most of us don’t know. I knew some artistes through the fvck u challenge . #NotjustokVS”
“Y’all slept on Tekno & Wizkid’s Mama. Smh. #NotjustokVS”
“Kizz Daniel is underrated sha, literally no bad songs even every feature was a hit #NotjustokVS”
“Musicians like runtown, patoranking,Tekno ,phyno , Flavour ,timaya are so much underated and underappreciated ,we all know y but see naira Marley ,zlatan etc are considered great musicians. That is the level of disrespect we see in naija music cos of tribalism #NotjustokVS”
” Kizz Daniel will remain a toddler to Tekno forever #notjustokvs”
” No single Kizz Daniel’s song can body Tekno’s Pana. That song is so dope with a clean video. Even Wizkid had to retweet the video for us all to watch again two months ago. That shows you how evergreen that song is. #notjustokvs
