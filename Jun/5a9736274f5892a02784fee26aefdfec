Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu on Monday begged Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State to sheathe his sword and return to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ize-Iyamu observed that the crisis in the APC is a family issue, and that such should make the Edo governor dump the party for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The Pastor said that there are bound to be issues in “every family” and it would be bad for Obaseki to leave the APC due to some disagreements.
Ize-Iyamu declared: “I will like to appeal to him to return to the party.
“In every family, you have disagreements; let it not be said that it was this disagreement that pushed him out.”
Pastor Ize-Iyamu, therefore, appealed that Governor Obaseki should “set aside his anger” and return to the APC, saying it will be a mistake for him to leave the party.
Pastor Ize-Iyamu on Monday emerged APC governorship candidate in Benin City, for the September 19, 2020 in Edo State.
Ize-Iyamu stated that he made that mistake before, noting, “and I have come to realize it was a grievous error and I would not want him as an elder brother to make the same mistake.”
“in APC, he is recognized as a leader but in the new party you are going to, it will be difficult for them to accept you as a leader.
“It would be nice for him to come back and we are ready to work with him and all well-meaning Edo people,” Ize-Iyamu said.
