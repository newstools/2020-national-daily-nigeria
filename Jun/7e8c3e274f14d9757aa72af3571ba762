Before now, Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki was among the good boys of the cabal in Aso Rock, where many believe he got some backwind that pushed him against his mentor and party’s national chairman Adams Oshiomhole. Now, he is a political orphan.
Worse, he is seeking help where there’s none—Aso Rock— after the party’s NWC gave him the boot on June 12 after the screening for the June 22 primary for the state guber election.
The embattled governor said he will be making his next move after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.
Obaseki made this known via his Twitter handle on Sunday.
“I appreciate the sustained show of solidarity, support, and goodwill from Edo people and Nigerians in the face of injustice by the @OfficialAPCNg screening committee. I will be making my next move known after I complete consultations with my supporters and meet with @MBuhari,” tweeted.
But Buhari, historically, doesn’t butt into party affairs at the state level. The experience of Lagos former Gov Akinwunmi Ambode, Zamfara, and others makes it predictable Obaseki will get a cold shoulder when he meets Buhari.
He screening committee alleged the governor’s academic documents are reddened with inconsistencies. And he fought his party and its national chairman by suing them. That contradicts the section 20 of the party’s rulebook.
Obaseki is planning to jump ship. The PDP and other parties in the opposition have been beckoning to him—not to hug him with their tickets though. Which might not only make sense to him, but also spells the end of his political career.
His rushing to Buhari now, and pretending to heed whatever the president advises, might make a good excuse for him to remain in the APC.
But the governors last-mnute consultation matters little as his future in politics is at stake—just like Ambode’s was when he also kicked his maker, APC national Bola Tinubu, in the teeth.
