Barely weeks after the demolition of a building inside the Nigerian Embassy in Ghana by yet to be identified armed persons, has the country’s embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia been attacked, this time by protesting Nigerians in the country.




Reacting to the attack, the federal government described the act as disgraceful and criminal.
Aggrieved Nigerians living in Indonesia destroyed properties of the embassy during a protest against discrimination and targetted raids by immigration officers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, condemned the act on Friday via Twitter. He vowed that perpetrators would be identified and punished accordingly.
Onyeama wrote; “Absolutely deplorable and disgraceful criminal behaviour by Nigerian hooligans, who without justification, attacked the Nigerian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia today.
“Totally unacceptable behaviour.
“Every effort will be made to identify them and see they are severely punished,’’ he tweeted.
