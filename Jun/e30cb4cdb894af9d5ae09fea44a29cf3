Abia Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has tested positive for coronavirus.
John Kalu, the state commissioner for information, revealed this this in a statement on Monday.
Ikpeazu becomes the fourth governor to have tested positive for the virus so far
“Recall that on Saturday, 30th May, 2020, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu volunteered his sample for COVID-19 test and subsequently directed members of the state Executive Council and those of the inter-ministerial committee on COVID-19 to submit themselves for the same test,’ he said.
“On Tuesday, 2nd June, 2020, the result of Governor Ikpeazu’s test returned negative.
“On Thursday, 4th June, 2020, the governor submitted another sample at the Nigeria Center For Disease Control laboratory for confirmation and the result returned positive.
“As a result, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has gone into isolation, as required by relevant NCDC protocols, and he is being managed by a competent team of medical practitioners with a view to nursing him back to good health.”
Govs Nasir el-Rufai, Bala Mhammed , and Seyi Makinde tested positive, and recovered in April.
Kalu added that the governor has directed his Deputy, Ude Chukwu, to act on his behalf pending his recovery and resumption of duties.
Abia was among the southeastern states that were apparently virus-free in the early days of the pandemic spread in Nigeria.
