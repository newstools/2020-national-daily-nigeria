A white man who claimed he was African American George Floyd’s accomplice in the $20-counterfeit payment has amplified the racial overtone of police brutality in the case—and others across the US.
“George Floyd and I were both arrested for allegedly spending a counterfeit $20 bill. For George Floyd, a man my age, with two kids, it was a death sentence. For me, it is a story I sometimes tell at parties. That, my friends, is White privilege,” tweeted Mar D. McCoy June 1.
The smothering of sickly Floyd has sparked a violent nationwide protest running to days now, and President Donald Trump is threatening retribution as he insists terrorists and anarchists have hijacked the protest many largely consider anti-racism demonstration.
“I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right,” Trump tweeted Friday.
American police has been reeling in accusation of racism for the better part of the Trump’s administration, and Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his veep Joe Biden have acknowledged this while they call for calm and activation of the process for change and police reform.
Floyd was lying face down, his neck pinned down by the white cop detaining him in that position for about 10 minutes as the suspect choked out ‘I can’t breathe, mama” in a video that trended on social media last week.
He died shortly after then.
The killer cop has been dismissed as Trump ordered the FBi to investigate the incident.
