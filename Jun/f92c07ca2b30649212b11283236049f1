The immediate past governor of Oyo, Abiola Ajimobi, is battling to save his life at the Anamiola First Cardiologist and Cardiovascular Consultants Hospital, Lagos.
That is the same facility   occupied by the late cOs Abba Kyari and some earlier VIPs that got infected were confederates.
The former governor was said to have infected people since two weeks ago he caught the virus..
Ajimobi, who is the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the All Progressives Congress, has been hospitalised since June 2, 2020.
He was said to have been confirmed positive earlier and was managing the situation at home before the illness worsened and he had to go to a hospital.
The complication which warranted the former governor’s seeking help at high brow hospital causes a lot of worries.
