The APC crisis has been presenting new twists daily since its national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was suspended days ago by a court order he and the party appealed in March.
The latest: A state High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, just declared that a former Deputy National Secretary Victor Giadom cannot be the acting national chairman of the party.
On June 18, an Abuja high court extended the order it gave Giadom to act as the party’s national chairman.
And acting on that, he declared himself as the party’s acting chairman, making him the first of three chieftains of the party acting in tht capacity. The party national vice chairman Abiola Ajimobi and his south-south counterpart Hilliard Eta were also appointed in that order.
Less than 24 hours after the drama, the state high court presided over by Justice Florence Fiberesima granted an order of perpetual injunction restraining Giadom from parading himself as a member of the APC NWC.
The court also granted an order restraining Giadom from issuing, signing or endorsing any document or correspondence to INEC or any other body or institution in the capacity of the national chairman or acting national chairman of the APC or howsoever as an officer of the APC.
Giadom, the court said, could not be claiming to be a member of the NWC having resigned from his position to contest the 2019 general election as the deputy governor.
