As the deputy governor of Ondo, Agboola Ajayi, defected to the PDP on weekend, following the earlier defection of Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki, the Rivers APC has also heated up their divisive politicking, sacking two executives in less than 48 hours.
In the midst of that, the party’s national headquarters is being roiled by protesters calling for the dissolution of the party’s NWC.
These are bad times for the ruling APC many have predicted may implode before 2023.
In the latest struggle in Rivers, Victor Giadom, the APC national deputy secretary sacked yesterday and replaced with Worgu Boms, for declaring himself acting national chairman, has been reinstated in the state on Monday.
The state executive committee then suspended Igo Aguma, the acting chairman of the party, that declared Giadom suspended, replacing him with Sokonte Davies.
Speaking on behalf of the committee, Sen. Andrew Uchendu accused Aguma of flouting the party’s constitution and making decisions without consulting relevant stakeholders.
All of that happened on Monday, at about the time the party’s NWC is swearing in a new national deputy secretary.
Uchendu also added that the suspension of Giadom as well as the nomination and appointment of Boms as a replacement, is illegal.
The ruling party’s crisis escalated after the party national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was suspended by court order obtained by Giadom last week.
Giadom is allegedly being sponsored by a minister, according to Oshiomhole who, many believe, is also bein backed by APC national chairman Bola Tinubu.
The only minister that fits the bill is Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi.
