The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Thursday cemented the crushing of the ousted national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole. The APC NEC, accordingly, dissolved the National Working Committee (NWC) which still has about two more years for the tenure to elapse. The APC NEC, thereafter, appointed a caretaker/convention committee.
The Thursday NEC meeting was boycotted by the NWC.
The APC NEC appointed Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, Chairman of APC Caretaker Committee and Extraordinary national convention for the election of new leaders and members of the potential new NWC.
Other resolutions at the NEC meeting include withdrawal of all cases in court by party members; ratification of the governorship primaries for the election I n Edo State.
The APC NEC meeting on Thursday was chaired by the acting national chairman, Victor Giadom; President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, 10 APC governors, and other party leaders.
The APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, was not part of the meeting, though not eligible to attend; his power bloc did not quite have strong representation at the meeting. The corollary is that new political calculus may be going on now in the Tinubu bloc as well as other blocs in APC.
