The Presidential Task force on COVID-19 (PTF) on Monday reviewed the nationwide coronavirus curfew imposed by President Muhammadu Buhari. The duration of the curfew was reviewed from 8.00pm to 6.00am to 10.00pm to 04.00am effective Tuesday. The reviewed of the curfew was an indication of the unwillingness of the federal government or the PTF members to end the coronavirus lockdown which has proved to be ineffective in containing the spread of the infection.
However, the lockdown is being eased in several states in Nigeria. Some states have ordered the reopening of Mosques, Churches and other worship centers, while selected businesses have also been reopened. Commerce has also resumed in virtually all the states in Nigeria as traders have returned to their shops.
However, the ban on inter-state travels have not been officially lifted but Nigerians have succumbed to economic pressures to defy the inter-state travel restriction and move at exorbitant transportation fares.
