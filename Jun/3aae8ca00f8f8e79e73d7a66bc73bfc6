Governors of the ruling All Prressives Congress (APC) were at the State House, Abuja, on Friday to assure President Muhammadu Buhari of the validity of the resolutions made at the Thursday National Executive Committee (NEC) in Abuja.
The APC National Executive Committee (NEC) at the Thursday meeting in Abuja, among other resolutions dissolved the partyâ€™s National Working Committees (NWC) and appointed a Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State. The meeting also ordered party members to withdraw all suits in the court of law and return for internal resolution of all conflicts.
The NEC made it clear that anyone who resists to withdraw the suits from the court will be doing so at his own risk.
The governors commended President Buhari for leading the process that led to the convening of the emergency NEC meeting.
