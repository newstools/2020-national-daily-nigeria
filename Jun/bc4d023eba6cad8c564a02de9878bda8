The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, on Friday justified the disqualification of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State by the APC screening committee from participating in the primary election on June 22 for the nomination of the party’s candidate for the September governorship election in Edo State. Oshiomhole said the party leadership complied with the APC constitution in the disqualification of Obaseki, his political arch-rival.
The APC screening committee appointed by Oshiomhole on Friday lost out of democratic norms strengthening Oshiomhole in the fight with Obaseki to disqualify the Edo governor from the party’s primary election. Obaseki clearly lost a structural battle to Oshiomhiole who controls the APC structures.
