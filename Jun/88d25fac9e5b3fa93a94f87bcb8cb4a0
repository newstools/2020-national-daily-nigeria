Nigerian artist, Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley held a concert in Abuja despite the social distancing order by government occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic.

The concert was initially planned to be a drive-in concert on Saturday but patrons reportedly violated social distancing rules.

This resulted in a crowd gathering in front of the stage while Naira Marley performed.

Social media users in Nigerian have lambasted Naira Marley on Twitter, and other social media platforms for the concert.

Some have called on authorities to punish the ‘Soapy’ hit maker.
