The national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Sunday ignored APC governors who were in Lagos on consultation on the partyâ€™s primary election to nominate the governorship candidate for the September election in Edo State, as well as on the feud between APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State.
Nine APC governors were led to the meeting with Tinubu on Sunday at the Lagos House, Marina, by Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum.
Tinubu had insisted that APC must conduct direct primary election for the election of its governorship candidate in Edo State, as well as Ondo State. He had reprimanded the Edo governor, challenging him to go and prepare for primary election and test his popularity. The APC leader was said to have thereafter walked out of the meeting.
Meanwhile, Oshiomhole and the Tinubu alliance are sponsoring Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu for the Edo State APC governorship ticket at the June 22 primary election.
