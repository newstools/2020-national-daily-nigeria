Hours after he got a court order permitting a motion on restraining order to be served on him, Gov. Godwin Obaseki bounced back again with another court order declaring him eligible to run for the PDP primary election on Thursday.
The latest order came from a high court in Edo, of the Ekpoma judicial division, on Tuesday.
The earlier petition seeking to restraint him was brought by Omoregir Ogbeide-Ihama, one of the PDP aspirants, in the Thursday election.
Speaking trough his media aide Crusoe Osagie, the governor said his opponents in the PDP were already jittery about the overwhelming support the party was receiving from the people.
“The court order was obtained last night. Our opponents outside the party are trying to use fifth columnists within us to replicate the chaos in their party.
“They are worried about the popularity and acceptance of the PDP and our amiable Governor so much so that they have become desperate in their quest to stop a contest they know they will lose.”
