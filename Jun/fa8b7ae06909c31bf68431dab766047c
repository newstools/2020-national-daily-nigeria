The Media Aide to Senator Abiola Ajimobi, former Oyo State Governor, Bolaji Tunji, has debunked reports that the former Oyo State governor is dead. Tunji described the report which was trending Thursday evening as fake news.
The report had indicated Ajimobi died in Lagos on Thursday following underlying health conditions worsened by coronavirus infection.
The former Oyo Governor who was appointed Acting National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole has been on sick bed since he was detected to have tested positive to coronavirus.
Ajimobi was hospitalised on June 2, 2020 at the First Cardiologist and Cardiovascular Consultants Hospital, Lagos. His wife, Florence, was also hospitalized on similar ailment, but was later discharged from hospital earlier.
The former Governor was said to have been confirmed positive earlier and was managing the situation at home before the illness worsened before he went to a hospital. He was said to have preferred private health facility to public facility as his condition worsened.
Meanwhile, the Media Aide has appealed for prayers for the recovery of his principal.
