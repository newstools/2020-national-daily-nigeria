The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as part of its new guidelines for places of worship across the country has warned churches and other places of worship to avoid any form of direct contact, especially handshakes to stem the spread of COVID-19.
In the new guidelines signed by Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, practices that require sharing of materials, like should also be limited.
The NCDC guidelines also demanded that religious centres be disinfected routinely, before and after worship.
It states that “there should be no entry without face masks. All attendees and religious leaders must wear a face mask. People who are sick should not go to places of worship. There should be temperature screening on entry.
“Hand washing facilities and hand sanitisers should be provided at the point of entries and strategic points, and attendance at religious settings should not exceed 1/3 of sitting capacity.”
The NCDC guidelines which also provide additional requirements to ensure that places of worship are safe demanded that religious centres be clearly marked such that people sit and maintain a two-metre distance from each other.
