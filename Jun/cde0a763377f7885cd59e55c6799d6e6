The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. (Dr) Mudashiru Obasa, on Thursday described the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, as a shining star, whose positive impact on Nigeria is being felt across nations.

Obasa, in a congratulatory statement to celebrate Gbajabiamila, who clocked 58, said there could not have been a better time for the Speaker of the House of Representatives to serve Nigeria other than now when his experience in legislative practice has put the country in the right stead.

Thanking him for his support and roles in the advancement of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Obasa noted that Gbajabiamila’s political journey is a perfect example of what loyalty should be.

“On many fronts, Gbajabiamila has proven to be in tune with the challenges facing Nigeria. He seems to have solutions and ideas at the tip of his finger.

“Despite being the fourth citizen of the country, Gbajabiamila has never forgotten his roots. He constantly reaches out to his constituents and gives them feedbacks on government policies and steps,” Obasa, who chairs the Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures in Nigeria, said.

He also noted that under Gbajabiamila’s leadership of the House, activities of the lower legislative chamber have been more open to Nigerians.

“On behalf of all the Speakers of state Houses of Assembly in Nigeria, I congratulate you on your birthday just as I thank you too for your role in ensuring that the legislative arm of the Federal Government remains thick.

“I also join every Lagosian, your constituents and our party in wishing you all the best in the days ahead. Continue to walk with your head high,” Obasa said.
