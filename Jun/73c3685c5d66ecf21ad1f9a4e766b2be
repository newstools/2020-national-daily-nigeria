The Senator representing Plateau North at the National Assembly, Hon. Istifanus Gyang has said legislators will sustain the push for   State Assemblies autonomy early rejected by governors.
The Senator said for the principles of separation of powers to be effective, State legislatures should be financially independent.
Sen. Gyang stated this on Saturday in Riyom Local Government Area of the State where he commissioned 90 blocks of shops built for the community as part of his constituency projects.
According to the him: “We will push for the executive order 10, so that there will be proper checks and balance in the three arms of government.
“Governors are kicking against it, but it is unfair and undemocratic. Opposing the order was like opposing democracy itself, because a democratic set up should allow arms of government to operate for the purpose of separation of powers.
“After 21 years of democracy, our focus should be on building and strengthening institutions.
“The government of PDP that was in charge of Federal Government for 16 years brought institutions like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
“The party also established the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC).
“The Treasury Single Account (TSA) is also an initiative of the PDP government aimed at strengthening democracy,” Gyang said.
