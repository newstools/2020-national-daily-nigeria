Due to the slump in global oil price, escalated by the continuous ravaging effect of Coronavirus pandemic, the financial sustainability of states during this period has become a cause for worry, considering the partial halt in Economic activities.
It was also gathered that the Federal allocations to 34 states including the FCT, accounted for more than 50% of their total available revenue in 2019. This indicates that many states and local governments depend on monthly statutory allocations from the central vault to carry out their various state administration.
