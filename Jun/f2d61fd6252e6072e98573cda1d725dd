The All Progressives Congress (APC) quakes Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Sunday paid a sudden visit to Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in Port Harcourt. The meeting may not be unconnected with negotiations to decamp from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP after the illegal disqualification of his candidacy by the APC screening committee.
The visiting Governor Obaseki held immediate closed-door meeting at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on arrival.
The APC screening committee illegally disqualified Obaseki from participating in the governorship primary election for the election in Edo State.
There have been strong speculations about Obaseki’s defection to the PDP immediately after the screening tragedy. The Edo State governor had declined appealing the decision but maintained that he will decide on the next course of action after consultation with President Muhammadu Buhari.
Meanwhile, the Sunday visit to Rivers State Governor brings the report of Obaseki’s defection to PDP close to reality. It would appear that the Edo State Governor is set to announce is defection to PDP.
