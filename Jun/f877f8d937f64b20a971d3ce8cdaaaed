The Federal Capital Territory Administration has issued guidelines for re-opening of churches and mosques in the FCT.
The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, presided over a meeting between the FCT Administration and leaders of the FCT Christian Association of Nigeria and League of FCT Imams Initiative on Wednesday where they reviewed the guidelines issued by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for reopening of religious worship centers.
The FCT COVID-19 Emergency Response Team sent situation report on the pandemic in the FCT to the meeting to guide the review.
The Committee set up by the Minister on May 19, 2020, to provide guidelines for re-opening of churches and mosques also sent its report to the meeting.

The Minister appealed to FCT residents to pray for the end of the Covid-19 pandemic as the Churches and Mosques re-open.
The consensus between the FCT Administration and religious leaders, led to the following protocols guiding the re-opening of worship centres in the FCT:

All places of worship must sign up to full compliance with all aspects of non- pharmaceutical interventions required to protect the public from COVID-19 infection, including but not limited to:
Ensuring the supply of running water and soap/alcohol sanitisers at entry and exit points and in all high-contact locations, including bathrooms.

Mosques are to open 15 mins before Adhan and close 10 mins after prayers for the five prayers. Waiting period between Adhan and Iqamah should not be more than 10 minutes. Prayers are to be shortened to reduce duration of contact between congregations.

Islamiyah schools, All-Night Vigils, Sunday Schools and children activities are to remain suspended. For mosques, only the five daily prayers and Friday prayer services are allowed.
Mass gatherings that make compliance with physical distancing impossible are not allowed. Prayer sessions should be staggered if necessary, to encourage greater opportunity for physical distancing. Worshippers are encouraged to sign up for preferred service time and virtual worship option should be made available.
Churches and mosques should make provisions for separate entry and exit points and measures should be taken to direct the flow of people to avoid crowding and breach of physical distancing rules.

vii. There should be no social gatherings either before or after worship; and
viii. Business outlets within the church or mosque premises should remain closed.

Improve environmental hygiene and avoid surface contamination.
Churches and mosques are advised to make their premises free of carpets to allow easy and regular disinfection of floors and furniture.
All windows in churches and mosques should be kept open during services and the use of non-enclosed spaces/open air services are encouraged to be used as much as possible.

iii. High-touch surfaces, high traffic areas, common areas, and bathrooms should be frequently cleaned and disinfected and

Those responsible for sanitation should use dilute bleach (1000ppm) to disinfect all surfaces after removal of visible dirt. infected persons should be kept out to reduce the risk of onward transmission.
Public awareness campaign through effective messaging using conventional media and online outlets and placing of signages/notices at strategic locations. This should address common symptoms, risk of transmission, vulnerability to severe illness, etc;
Worshippers should be encouraged not to attend in person if experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, shortness of breath or have had close contact with an infected person in the last 14 days.

iii. All worshippers noted to have a temperature or are symptomatic on arrival at the place of worship should be excluded from participation.

Up-to-date records of staffing, including contact details and if possible, a full record of attendees at every service to enable contact tracing should be kept; and
Religious visits to homes by religious clerics are hereby discouraged.
The FCT Administration has recognized the importance of places of worship in our social and cultural way of life. They have equally been proven to be major sources of easy spread of the disease. It is therefore imperative that all places of worship adhere very strictly to the guidelines enunciated above.
The meeting also acknowledged that the situation of COVID-19 in the FCT is still at a very critical stage and recognizes that there is the danger that if the established protocols are not adhered to, the cases of those infected and fatalities will increase. It is therefore essential that all residents of the FCT take personal responsibility in ensuring strict compliance.
