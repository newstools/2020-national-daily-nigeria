The Court of Appeal in Abuja has upheld the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress.
That was the second decision made by a second panel of the appellate court following the first panel that first lifted the suspension.
A three-man panel of the court led by Justice Eunice Onyemanam, in a unanimous judgment on Tuesday, affirmed the order of suspension of the APC National Chairman earlier issued by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja on March 4, 2020.
Following an application by Oshiomhole, an earlier three-man panel led by Justice Abubakar Yahaya had earlier lifted the Oshiomhole’s suspension pending the hearing of his appeal.
But the Justice Onyemanam-led panel, which earlier heard the appeal on Tuesday, dismissed the appeal for lacking in merit.
Delivering the lead judgement, Justice Mohammed Lamido said the lower court had rightly issued the order of suspension on March 4, 2020.
But all of these are coming hours after the cross-carpeting of Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki, whose faction of the state APC, suspended their national chairman who has been in a running battle with the governor.
The party’s NWC kicked the governor out of the primary race because of his dodgy academic credentials.
