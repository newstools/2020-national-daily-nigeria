Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State may have rushed to Abuja to seek President Muhammadu Buhari intervention over the ravaging bandits that are almost turning Katsina and other states in northwest Nigeria to quasi-republic. The bandits appeared to acquired violence hardware overwhelming the capacity of security operatives in the zone. They not only operate with impunity; the bandits invade communities with ease and operate for convenient duration without modicum of intervention by security operatives. They have made life miserable for residents of the troubled states, essentially, Katsina.
Apparently, security was the crux of Governor Masari’s visit to the State house where he held meeting with President Buhari.
During Governor Aminu Bello Masari’s visit to the State House, President Buhari promised the people and government of Katsina State that his administration is working on renewed efforts, and review of operations, to improve the security of lives and property in Katsina State.
The President started bandits committing crimes, troubling innocent citizens in Katsina State will not go unpunished. He, therefore, ordered bandits to disarm themselves and surrender their weapons, or face “disgraceful and violent ends’’.
President added that more decisive military operations will be taken in Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, Katsina, and Kaduna States to flush out the bandits.
President Buhari, thereafter, commiserated with Gov Masari over the loss of lives from attacks by bandits, which include District Head of Yantumaki, Alhaji Atiku Maidabino, and APC Chairman in Batsari Local Government Council, Alhaji Abdulhamid Sani Duburawa.
