Governor Nyasom Wike of Rivers state may have overtly sidelined former Vice President Atiku Abubakar ahead of permutations for the 2023 presidency, National Daily has gathered.
Gov. Wike on Monday during an interview offered an olive branch to his political arch rival and Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi under one condition if he has any intention to run for 2023 Presidency.
In a move that has shocked Nigerians as well as the political class owing to the history between the two arch rivals, Governor Wike disclosed this in an interview granted with Arise Television.
Governor Wike offered Rotimi Amaechi his support if he returns to PDP to contest for presidency. The condition to return to PDP for his support is to avoid committing anti-party activity by supporting Amaechi under APC.
Governor Wike also denied speculations that he would be contesting for the Aso Rock job, saying he has no interest to contest after his tenure in office comes to an end.
The recent position by Gov Wike further affirms his intention not to support the partyâ€™s former presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar who is understood to be gearing up for another contest for the plum job.
By offering to support Amaechi for presidency if he returns to PDP, this shows that there are no permanent enemies or friends in political but permanent interests.
