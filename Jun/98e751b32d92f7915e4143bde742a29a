The deputy national secretary of the riling All ProgressivesÂ Congress (APC), Victor Giadom, may have humbled the suspended APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and his National Working Committee (NWC) who attempted to scuttle his assumption of office as APC acting national chairman, as he secures court interim order to assume the office. The APC NWC had urgently endorsed Senator Abiola Ajimobi, Deputy National Chairman, South, to become acting national chairman immediately the Court of Appeal upheld the suspension of Oshiomhole from the party. Unfortunately, Ajimobi died Thursday evening. Giadom had insisted on resumption as APC acting national chairman citing a court judgement in March but the NWC resisted him and imposed Ajimobi, compelling Giadom to return to court for reaffirmation.
Accordingly, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, reaffirmed the authority Giadom to act as APC National Chairman pending the election of a substantive national chairman.
The court further authorized Mustapha Salihu, APC National Vice Chairman North East, to act as APC National Secretary.
It was highlighted that the applicant, Mustapha Salihu, in an exparte motion requested the court to authorize Giadom to become APC acting national chairman pending the determination of the motion on notice
No date has been fixed for hearing of the substantive suit.
