Management of the University of Ibadan in a statement on Sunday insisted that Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo was issued one certificate when he graduated in 1979, and not two as being claimed by the party.
It would be recalled that one of the reasons cited for the disqualification of Godwin Obaseki from APC’s June 22 governorship primary in Edo State was that the University of Ibadan awarded him two certificates with separate dates.
The committee also stated that it found it difficult to vouch for the authenticity of his National Youth Service Corps certificate as there was no indication as to where he served.
However, UI Registrar, Olubunmi Faluyi, in the statement said the institution’s stand remained as contained in an earlier statement that “Obaseki gained admission to the University in 1976 and graduated in 1979 with a Second Class Honours, Lower Division.
In the same vein, the varsity’s Director of Public Communications, Olatunji Oladejo, said the claim by the APC was not true.
“We stand by our statement on Obaseki. How can you issue two certificates to a candidate? That is not true. It is not possible. He graduated in 1979 from the university. We issued only one certificate to him, not two,” he added.
