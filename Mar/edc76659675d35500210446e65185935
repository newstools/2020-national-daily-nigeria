Several Nigerians have curiously been waiting for the donation of the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as some statesmen and notable individuals have commenced generous donations to alleviate the harsh condition created by the ravaging coronavirus in Nigeria.
Several Nigerian stakeholders who spoke to this Reporter were of the view that this is the time to know true Nigerian leaders or real friends of the people. They emphasized that at this time of threatening national epidemic, Nigerian politicians should be above board of only thinking of political investments or elections expenditures to win peoples support.
While commending former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for the N50 million donation, beside others, to coronavirus aid, they added that the APC national leader, Tinubu, should also show Nigerans how much love he has for them.
Several others have also challenged all Nigerian politicians to distribute rice and money the way they do during elections at the crucial period of national crisis.
Donations made so far by Nigerians of goodwill for coronavirus palliatives include:
Aliko Dangote N1 billion, Abdulsamad Rabi’u N1 billion Femi Otedola N1 billion, Tony Elumelu N1 billion, Herbert O. Wigwe N1 billion, Segun Agbaje N1 billion, Jim Ovia N1 billion, Atiku Abubakar N50 million, 2Face Idibia N10 million, etc.
