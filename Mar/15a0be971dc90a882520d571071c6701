A former Governor of Kano has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the removal of Muhammadu Sanusi as Emir of Kano.
Kwankwaso, who installed Sanusi in 2014, made the allegation Wednesday while describing the removal of Sanusi as a sad incident to both Kano State and Nigeria in general.
In an interview with the BBC Hausa, the former governor said contrary to claims, Buhari had interfered in the Kano emirate crisis.

“We believe here in Kano that Buhari interferes where he wishes,” said Kwakwanso.
“Kano state government officials have been saying they were directed to dethrone Mr Sanusi ll. Buhari instructed them.”
According to him,  Buhari “doesn’t interfere where his intervention is needed, but interferes on issues he is supposed to be neutral about.”
He, however, described  Sanusi as a global citizen.
Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje’s administration knocked Sanusi off the throne Monday, claiming the monarch misappropriated emirate fund and abused his traditional office
A new emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, has since been appointed while Sanusi begins exile somewhere between Nasarawa and Abuja.
