Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has tested positive for coronavirus.

Arteta said: ‘This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I’m allowed.’

He, and the entire first-team squad and coaching staff will now be self-isolating in accordance with the most recent government guidelines.

Arsenal played Olympiacos in the Europa League a couple of weeks ago, and since then the Greek club’s owner Evangelos Marinakis has tested positive for the virus.

Wolves’ match against Olympiacos on Thursday evening was played behind closed doors as a precaution.

Arsenal have closed down the London Colney training centre after the manager received a postitive covid-19 result on Thursday evening.

A number of people from the Hale End Academy will also be in self-isolation, and the facility has been closed as a precaution as well. Both training centres will undergo a deep clean.
