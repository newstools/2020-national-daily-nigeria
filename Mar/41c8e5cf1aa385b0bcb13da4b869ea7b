More than 4000 people across the world have died in four months after being infected by coronavirus which broke out of Wuhan in China last December.
Most of the victims living are white, all of the dead were white too, making fringe theorists believe that the black race is immune to the virus—until March 17.
Junior Health Minister Olorunmbe Mamoora just announced the first black man, a Nigerian, Olumide Okunnuga, infected, died.
Making it the second death relating to Africa. 
The first was in Egypt on March 10. He was however not an African—but a German—a tourist visiting Egypt.
Okunnuga’s death shattered the black man’s immunity hypothesis—but not completely.
Okunnuga, a medical doctor, lived in Italy, and contacted the disease in Canada where the 63-year-old died.
Apparently no African, especially blacks, who contacted it on the continent have died on the continent.
South Africa’s cases have confirmed cases have risen to 38; Nigeria’s 3, including an Italian, a Nigerian who later turned positive, and the third case just announced in Lagos.
But Nigeria keeps warning its citizens not to fall for the unscientific vaporizing.
“There are a lot of things known about COVID-19 and there are still things unknown. We have to be very careful about believing claims that are yet to be fully validated,” Mamoora said.
