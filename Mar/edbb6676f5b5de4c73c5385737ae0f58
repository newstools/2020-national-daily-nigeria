The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has explained why decided to close seven gas firms refilling Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Gas) cylinders in Lagos state.
Recall that the DPR had recently shut down Banner Gas LPG refilling plant in Lekki Phase I; Top Gas LPG, Jakande, Lekki; Dolax Gas, Ifako, Gbagada; Spades Energy Limited, Maryland; Daridson Gas Plant, Iroko Awe Town, Elegushi, Lekki Phase II; Pivot Cooking Gas Plant, Bariga, and Chibuzor Gas, Maryland.
The DPR explained that the shutdown was as a result of its surveillances which revealed that the gas companies were operating illegally in the state. The firms were reportedly operating without licence from the regulator.
Also, some of the gas companies were accused of situating their facilities amidst densely populated areas and under high-tension lines.
According to the Zonal Operations Controller DPR in Lagos, Ayorinde Cardoso, the shutdown will curb illegal operations currently ongoing in the market, as well as avert gas explosions.
Cardoso said operators of gas must operate in accordance with the rules and regulations of the market as the DPR intends to double its surveillance on illegal activities under the new Director, Sarki Auwalu who was appointed in December by President Muhammadu Buhari.
