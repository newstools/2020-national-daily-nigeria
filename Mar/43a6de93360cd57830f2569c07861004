A prominent Yoruba leader in the southwest Nigeria, Femi Fani-Kayode, has warned that the southwest has come under siege of invasion by external forces. He noted that the explosions that have been occurring from one state to the other, starting from Ekiti to Lagos, then, Ondo, are not mere explosions but bomb detonation. He feared that the attackers may be testing the grounds and watching what will become of the Yoruba warlords with the ongoing explosions which he decried Yoruba leaders have continued to ignore.
Explosions in the southwest is gradually becoming frequent since the establishment of Amotekun by the governors of the six southwest states and other prominent Yoruba leaders. The explosions have been causing devastating damages at the different locations with the federal authorities giving light reasons for the occurrences.
Though, the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, had advocated for investigation of the Abule Ado explosion that brought down some houses in the vicinity, the authorities have been silent on it.
Then, the Ondo State devastating explosion along Akure – Owo road which cut off the road, destroyed houses and killed some persons.
Femi Fani-Kayode aptly cautioned: “first, it was Ekiti, then, Abule Ado in Lagos and now, Akure. If we like, we should keep kidding ourselves saying that these are not bombs and that we are not being targeted.
“Let’s hope that by the end of all these, there will still be someone left standing to defend the southwest.”
Since the legislatures in the six southwest states passed the bills on Amotekun, the security structure is yet to effectively commence operations. Perhaps, the threatening coronavirus spread had slowed down activities on Amotekun but the perceived attackers are gradually pushing inwards into the territory, and perhaps, testing the effectiveness of their capabilities and strategies, portrayed by Femi Fani-Kayode.
