The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has cautioned against panic buying of fuel, declaring that it has enough petroleum products to serve Nigerians for over sixty days, saying there is no reason for panic buying.
Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the NNPC, made the announcement during a media briefing in Abuja on Sunday.
He mentioned that there was a synergy among all stakeholders to achieve petroleum products sufficiency across the country.
Kyari said “of course people because of the pandemic, stay at home, may try to conserve fuel, there is no need to do this.”
“Maintain your normal life, we have secured all assurances that trucks will be moving freely across the country throughout this period of difficulty and supply will be sustained.”
The NNPC boss admonished the citizenry not to crowd filling stations, noting that there was no need for it.
He said the NNPC would continue to involve National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) in reaction to NARTO’s directive that petrol tankers’ drivers should leave the depots.
“No restrictions; as we speak now loading is going on, trucks are moving around, no action like that will come to fruition.”
