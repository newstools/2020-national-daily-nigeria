The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Abubakar III, has listed other things plaguing Nigerians that are by far deadlier than the dreaded Coronavirus.
According to the monarch, who spoke at a meeting of the Inter-Religious Council in Abuja, hunger was killing more people than Coronavirus
The meeting was attended by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.
Speaking on the theme of the meeting, ‘Together, we can grow peace for the Nation,’ the Sultan warned that “no individual or religion would be spared should the country be torn apart.”
He said: “There is a very serious virus that is killing people much higher than coronavirus. That virus is hunger; there is hunger virus and it’s very serious. You need to go round the country into the villages, into the towns and see how people are really struggling to survive.”
The Sultan also insisted that there was no such thing as persecution of Christians in Nigeria as alleged by the Christian Association of Nigeria and other Christian bodies.
He further noted that Nigerian Muslims were equally being killed in large numbers by terrorists and bandits.
The monarch, who is the President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, called on aggrieved parties denied rights to build mosques or churches in some locations as the case may be, to approach relevant authorities to solve the problem rather than attribute such actions to persecution.
“For me, there is no persecution of anybody in this country because if you say there is persecution of Christians, there is also persecution of Muslims but that will not solve the problem”, he said.
