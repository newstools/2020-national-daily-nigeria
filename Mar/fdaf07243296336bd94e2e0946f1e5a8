Report has emerged that both Chelsea and Liverpool are cooling their interest in Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho, thus clearing the way for Manchester United to sign the teenager this summer.

National Daily gathered that the young English sensation has been attracting continuous attention from the Premier League’s biggest clubs, credit to his fabulous campaign for Borusssia Dortmund with 14 goals and 16 assists in just 23 Bundesliga league outings.
Sancho has enjoyed a fabulous campaign this season
Manchester United are desperate to make Sancho their marquee signing this summer and had feared competition from their Premier League rivals, but National Daily understands that the Old Trafford club now appear to have a clear run at the youngster
National Daily further gathered from the report by The Mirror, that Chelsea and Liverpool have been put off by Dortmund’s mammoth £120million asking price and fear they cannot compete with United’s spending power.

Meanwhile, Sancho is believed to favour a move to United as he is reported to be drawn towards the prospect of developing his talent in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s young United side.
Again, it is assumed that it could be difficult for Sancho to force his way into Liverpool starting XI considering Jurgen Klopp’s front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, with more options on his bench.
More interestingly, United are reportedly making plans to withdraw No. 7 jersey from Alexis Sanchez in favour of Sancho.
