The general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God has reacted to the ban placed on churches and mosques by the Lagos and Ogun governments on Wednesday.
The Lagos and federal governments placed a ban on all religious gatherings involving over 50 worshipers, having concluded a dialogue with religious bodies on the need to contain coronavirus gradually scaling up in Nigeria.
In a statement on Wednesday night , the RCCG leader Pstor E.A. Adeboye instructed parishes with the average of fifty members or less, to go on with their services.
Parishes that have the capacity to run more than one service should go on making sure members do not exceed 50, the statement added.
The RCCG is one of the biggest churches in Nigeria, having parishes on practically every street in most part of the nation.
