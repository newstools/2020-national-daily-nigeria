The palace of the Emir of Kano has remained vacant after the exit of Emir Mahammad Sanusi II who was dethroned by the Kano State government on Monday.  National Daily investigation revealed that the new Emir of Kano appointed by the state government, Emir Aminu Ado Bayero, is still in Bichi where he has been presiding as the Emir of Bichi on parallel status with the deposed Emir Muhammad Sanusi II.  Our source from Kano revealed that Bichi is about 85 kilometers away from Kano enroute Katsina State.
Emir Aminu Ado Bayero has been presiding as the Emir of Bichi which is one of the four rival emirates created by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State to weaken the powers of the Emir of Kano, dethroned Emir Sanusi II.
Emir Aminu Ado Bayero will have to relinquish the throne of the Emir of Bichi before proceeding to resume as the paramount Emir of Kano.
National Daily findings further revealed that the nomination of Aminu Ado Bayero as the new Emir of Kano doused tension in Kano and restored calm in the metropolis and entire state. Our source said that the people of Kano found no need for protest after the nomination of Ado Bayero by the Kingmakers and his endorsement by the Kano State government.
There is wide belief that Aminu Ado Bayero was the right heir apparent to the throne after the death of his father in 2014 but political manipulation of the state government under the leadership of former Governor Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso took the throne away from Aminu which has now been restored by Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje. The people, according to our source, feel that justice has been restored in Kano; adding that this is the Emir they desired.
