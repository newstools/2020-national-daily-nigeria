The Speaker of the Lagos state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has insisted that the political empire of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), in Lagos remains intact and strong.
Obasa made this statement on Wednesday following reported insinuations of friction between him and Bayo Oshinowo, a former member of the state Assembly and current senator representing Lagos East at the National Assembly.
The Speaker maintained that the party in Lagos remained united and that what happened recently at the House of Assembly involving the removal of two principal officers and the suspension of two others was a measure to ensure that the legislature remained strengthened and its sanctity maintained.
According to the Speaker, instilling discipline among members of the state’s House of Assembly did not equate with friction in any form between him and members of the party.
Obasa stressed that Tinubu has gone through a lot building the APC in Lagos and Nigeria, adding that nobody in his right senses would do anything to be a clog in the wheel of the party’s progress.
“The legislature must remain strong at all times, especially in relation to Nigeria’s democracy because it is often the hardest hit where issues in the democratic journey pop up.
“This is why during plenary on Monday, March 9, I made this proclamation: ‘The parliament is a heartbeat of every democratic system, its sanctity, integrity and positive reputation should be guided and protected, hence discipline is a key and where it’s lacking, the hope of the people fizzle,” he said.
To further prove that the House of Assembly is united, Obasa said 33 members of the House sat at plenary on Tuesday with the newly elected principal officers, including the deputy leader carrying out their tasks as expected.
