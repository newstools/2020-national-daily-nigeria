The Presidency on Thursday debunked reports of attack on President Muhammadu Buhari while in Kebbi State to observe the Argungu Fishing and Cultural Festival.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in a statement un Abuja, acknowledged that Prescient Buhari was in Kebbi on Thursday to declare open the Argungu Fishing and Cultural Festival.
He noted that it was the first time the international tourism event would hold in 11 years, as security considerations had rendered it impracticable.
He highlighted that as the President went round the arena to inspect rice pyramids on display, and take photographs with farmers, “a young man was so very excited to see his President so close. He made an attempt to get to him.”
Adesina decried that World over, such would not be allowed by security details. “The young man was prevented, and he protested that he should be allowed to greet his President. Now, professional contortionists are making mischief of the event. They are passing the video clip off on social media as an attempt to attack the President,” Adesina protested.
The SA lamented that malicious people always twist things to give a negative narrative. “But they simply dash their heads against the wall. The country moves on,” he said.
An eight second video went viral on the social media on Thursday showing a man who attempted to attack the President but for the urgent intervention of security operatives.
