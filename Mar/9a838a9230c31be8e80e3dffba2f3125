Spanish Laliga side Leganes have agreed a deal in principle to sign Nigeria international defender Chidozie Awaziem permanently from FC Porto when his loan spell with Leganes expires,National Daily learnt.
Awaziem is presently on a season long loan to the Laliga side from Porto and so far he has impressed despite the fact that Leganes have struggled for most part of the season before the suspension of games due to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
The Nigerian have been ever present in the heart of Leganes defence this season and his performance has not gone unnoticed with Sevilla firmly poised to sign him in the summer.
Leganes are keen on retaining him but the opportunity to play for a top team like Sevilla is one that the 22 year old is willing to explore rather than stay with a team that is battling to retain their top flight status.
A fee is yet to be agreed with FC Porto but already the representatives of the player have held talks with Sevilla and they are confident that Porto wonâ€™t stand in the way of Awaziem and a transfer fee of 8 million euros will be sufficient to get the deal done.
