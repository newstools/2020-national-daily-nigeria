A Federal High Court on Tuesday affirmed Governor Douye Diri as validly elected governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the primary election during the state Congress on September 3, 2019 in Bayelsa State.
The presiding judge, Justice Tijani Ringim, delivering judgement which lasted for about two hours, dismissed the suit filed by Timi Alaibe, saying he failed to prove his case.
Alaibe had approached the Federal High Court in Yenagoa Judicial Division, Bayelsa State, demanding cancellation of the result of the PDP primary election, arguing that the primary election in the state was manipulated, adding that the process was flawed.
The former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Timi Alaibe, lost the PDP primary election Senator Douye Diri who subsequently won the election through Supreme Court judgement.
The judgement of the court on Tuesdays disappointed Timi Alaibe on his ambition to reclaim the PDP ticket and be made the Governor of Bayelsa State. The judgement further disappointed the All Progressives Congress (APC) members who were full of expectations that the court may throw out Governor Diri through the candidacy suit.
Diri has further put those prophets to shame who declared that he would be removed from office within 7o days and some others who prophesied that he would stay in office for a short time.
