It is a crucial day for the embattled former Nigerian footballer and coach as his appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) to upturn a life ban by FIFA comes up for hearing.
It is however not clear if the current non contact posture all over the world over coronavirus spread will allow the hearing to hold.
The lawyers representing Siasia will be making three-point demand.
The prayers being sought are to upturn the decision by the FIFA adjudicatory chamber, which found Siasia guilty of breaching art.11 (Bribery) of the 2009 edition of the FIFA Code of Ethics.
He was therefore banned for life from all football-related activities (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level. In addition, a fine in the amount of CHF 50,000 has been imposed on Siasia.
The lawyers representing Siasia are seeking justice in CAS and their prayers are:
To lift the life ban; to quash the CHF 50,000 ($52,000) fine and to reinstate the Siasiaâ€™s status in football and his costs ameliorated.
The CAS hearing is expected to take place at the CAS Court Office, Avenue de Beaumont 2, 1012, Lausanne, Switzerland.
