Africa’s richest man and the President/Chief Executive, Dangote Industries Limited, Aliko Dangote has dropped down the Forbes rich list after his total net worth dropped by $2.5bn in the last 30 days.
Bloomberg Billionaires Index reports that the ranking of the world’s 500 richest people, showed that Dangote’s wealth fell from $15.9bn as of February 25, 2020, to $13.4bn on March 26.
Dangote who had risen to a high of $16.5bn on January 27, 2020, was the only Nigerian on the list of 500 billionaires and retained his position as Africa’s richest person in the latest ranking which now makes him the 77th richest person in the world with $13.4bn.

It also has interests in sugar, salt, flour, fertiliser and packaged food,” Bloomberg said.
