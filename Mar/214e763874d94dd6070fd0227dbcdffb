Oyo Gov. Seyi Makinde has tested positive for coronavirus.







Makinde disclosed this in a series of tweets from his official handle on Monday evening.
“I just received my COVID-19 confirmation test result. It is POSITIVE. I am asymptomatic and will continue to self-isolate.
“I have designated Prof Temitope Alonge, former Chief Medical Director of the University College, Ibadan, as the Head of COVID-19 Task Force while I recover fully. Please continue to comply with all the directives from the COVID-19 Task Force. Stay home, stay safe,” he wrote.
Makinde becomes the first governor from the southwest  to be infected, following his colleagu in Bauchi, Gov. Bala Mohammed, and Kaduna Gov. Nasir el-Rufai testing positive last week.
