A double-dipping Brit eloped with his squeeze to have a good time in Italy.
It turned it was a bad time.
He was infected with Coronavirus, and was going to be stranded in the lockdown in Italy before he eventually got the last flight to the UK where he is now quarantined.
According to the Sun, the man confessed what he went to do in Italy, and that his wife has no idea.
Mr Cheater is expected to pull through—though he is said to be in a ‘blind panic’ as contemplates the likelihood of his trusting wife discovering his infidelity.
Confirmed cases in the UK stand at 1,543. No fewer than 56 people have died after infection.
