Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has denied any government decision to order the banishing of the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, from the state. He maintained that the statement of the state government was clear on the dethronement of the Emir, noting that there was nowhere in the announcement by the Secretary to the state government that  mention was made on the banishment of the Emir who was dethroned on Monday.
Accordingly, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Kano State, Ibrahim Muktar, on the morning programme of  Channels Television on Wednesday, argued: “.. If you listen to the Secretary to the State Government when he was addressing the press on the issue of the removal of the emir from office, there was nowhere he said the emir was even banished from Kano State.
“So, the decision of the government was (that) the emir … as of Monday was removed from office and a new emir was appointed. The issue of banishment was not part of the decision of the Kano State Government.”
However, after the dethronement of the Emir, Police personnel besieged the palace and monitored the evacuation of the deposed Emir from the palace, who was subsequently, driven out of the city of Kano in a convoy that included police escort.
