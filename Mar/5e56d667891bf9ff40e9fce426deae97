The ex-Nigerian player Odion Ighalo who is on a six months transfer loan from China Shanghai from January transfer this summer has impressed Ole Gunnar a lot.

Ole Gunnar said that Shanghai Shenhua will demand a whooping sum of £15million to keep Odion Ighalo as a permanent Manchester United player.

The Chinese only paid £5.27million naira on Odion Ighalo when he left his former club CC Yati in February last year.

But the six months transfer on Ighalo so far has favoured Manchester United greatly.

Ighalo has scored four goals in different football competition and made assist since he moved to Manchester United.

Ole Gunnar has hinted that Manchester United could make the deal permanent. If this happens, there’s every possibility that he will get the Number 9 jersey.

Odion Ighalo scored his fourth goal against LASK and would have made his fifth also just that he hit the bar post.

Having played in China, Odion has not been noticed that was why he went on a transfer loan to Manchester United.
