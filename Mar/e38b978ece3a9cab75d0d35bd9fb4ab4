Taking to Instagram, Dammy Krane shared a screenshot of the DM he received from the ‘African Queen’ crooner.
The veteran singer explained that he was facing some legal issues at the time which hindered him from fulfilling his responsibilities for his signee.
“Dammy u know I tell people that I didn’t do much for you because you made yourself. You have a good charisma and you’re so alive with your movement. I wish I didn’t have all that legal sh*t when you were in Hypertek”, 2face wrote in the DM.
Dammy Krane, however, wasn’t bitter about it and he seemed to have moved on from the past as heaped praises on the veteran singer.
The ‘Confess’ singer wrote;
“@official2baba I will continue to celebrate u, King! This message inspires me daily to make sure I do more for everybody I can reach 20Years&ForeverAKing”
