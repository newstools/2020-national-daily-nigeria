Derik Osede Prieto is no exception, as he has already switched his international allegiance to Nigeria despite representing Spain at youth level and winning the 2012 U19 European Championship, National Daily learnt.
The former Real Madrid academy graduate, who was born in Madrid to a Nigerian father and a Spanish mother currently plays for Numancia in the Segunda Division.
Derik joined Real Madrid in 2002 and rose from the C team to the B team but was only called up to the senior team once during his time at the Bernabeu and that was when he made the substitute bench for the La Liga clash against Deportivo La Coruna in 2015.
It’s the dream of every footballer to represent his fatherland and win major trophies.
This season, the 27-year-old has been an ever-present member of the Numancia team, scoring two goals and receiving no yellow card in 22 appearances.
Former Super Eagles coach Samson Siasia met with Derik when he was playing for English club Bolton Wanderers in the buildup to the 2016 Olympic Games, but he didn’t make the final squad due to club engagement.
Derik bears all the hallmarks of a modern-day defender – he’s good in the air, nice passer of the ball and a good communicator.
