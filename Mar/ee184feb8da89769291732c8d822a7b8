Senator Dino Melaye at the weekend exposed Senator Smart Adeyemi to ridicule, including the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi State with urgent intervention to protect the people of his senatorial district against the spread of the ravaging coronavirus that has brought the entire world to standstill.
Senator Melaye demonstrated that he continues to be the people’s senator not minding that he is no longer in government with the distribution of large quantities of face masks, sanitizers, anti-bacterial hand washing materials and Vitamin C to residents of Kogi West senatorial district.
The senator representing the district in the National Assembly, Smart Adeyemi, is yet to register his presence with his people during the current coronavirus crisis.
Senator Dino Melaye expressing solidarity with his people, prayed: “God will heal our land.”
