There appear to be seeming panic in the Supreme Court over the review suit on the Imo State Governorship election which the court adopted results rejected by the tribunal as forged to declare Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the election and nullified the victory of Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The Supreme Court was to commence hearing on the review suit brought before it by Ihedioha and the PDP this Monday but had to further adjourned sitting to Tuesday.
Counsel to Ihedioha, Kanu Agabi, disclosed that he was served a process in court this morning even when the matter was yet to be called up for hearing.
“I de inside court.  I am waiting for my matter to be called,” when the notice of adjournment was served, Agabi had said.
it was, however, noted that the judges were handling the Zamfara State review suit.  “They are trying to sort out the issues of service on the 140th – 178th respondent,” it was noted.
It was further observed that there was apparently no proof of service of the hearing notice and processes on them. Mike Ozekhome  SAN was said to be complaining of difficulty in serving them as well as the 141st – 148th.
Zamfara review suit was adjourned to March 10 but Ozekhome  had objected saying that he has medical appointment in London on the adjourned date. Thus, the court adjourned to 17th March 2020.
