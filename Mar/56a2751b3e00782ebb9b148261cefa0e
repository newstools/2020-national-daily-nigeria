Anita Joseph, a popular Nigerian actress who recently got married despite all odds with her love interest Michael Fisayo, Nigerian comedian, popularly known as MC Fish has made some revelations about their relationship.

In a recent interview she had with ‘the sun’ she revealed why she said ‘i do’ to the love of her life.

“There’s actually a lot that got me really interested in him, he’s dress sense, humour, company, trust and respect he has for me. And above all he’s God fearing. “

“Our relationship started after we met at an event. It was love at first sight and it was like magic. I settled for MC fish because you know, sometimes you just see someone and you know in your heart that God has settled this one.

“I was looking forward to it because we were so close; we think alike, behave alike and we love everything about us. When he brought it (the marriage proposal) up, I said why not? It was a beautiful one. Who again I for marry? He’s the best person to marry. So, I’d say yes over and over again.”

Speaking on how she copes sexually when her hubby is not in town, Anita Joseph shares her top secret, “Sex is spiritual; it needs to be done with the right person. When my partner is not around, Haaaa, I control it o! We talk everyday, every morning, afternoon and night… So, I don’t yearn for sex that way. Before he travels, he makes sure he refills my tank. You know that type that will last for at least a week?”
