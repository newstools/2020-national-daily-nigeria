The Federal Government has urged Nigerians to get ready for tougher measures to help curtail the ongoing spread of Corona Virus Disease (CONVID-19).
This was disclosed by the Minister for Information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed during a press briefing in Abuja.
Mohammed pointed out that these measures will be unveiled within the next 24 to 48 hours, just as the Federal Government has expressed its willingness to use the military and the Nigerian Police for contact tracing.
It expressed worries that more than 1,300 contacts who have dissolved into the society and yet to be traced.
The government said with the likely multiplication of infections every five days, thousands would have been affected.
The Minister said: “We should be ready for tougher measures. The forms they will take will be out from the end of today or tomorrow. But Nigerians should be ready for tougher measures.
“If we don’t do proper contact tracing, the figure will multiply every five days. Nigerians must take ownership of this initiative. We won’t hesitate to use whatever measure to ensure that you do not endanger other Nigerians. Containment is very cheaper than cure. A few people have helped. If you know you traveled recently, give yourself up to relevant agencies.
“If the situation warrants, we may be forced to use the police and the military for contact tracing. The police is already working on that. We don’t want the figure we have now to multiply. We should work towards containment which is cheaper.”
