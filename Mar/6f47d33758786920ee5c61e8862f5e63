UK boxing world-champion Amir Khan has offered to donate a 60,000 square foot building, meant to be wedding venue, to the National Health System (NHS).
“I am aware of how difficult it is for the public to get a hospital bed in this tragic time,” he said.
The building is located in the town of Bolton and is worth $5.9 million, according to Manchester Evening News.
Football star Lionel Messi has also pledged a million dollars to help in the fight.
