A renowned human rights legal practitioner based in Lagos, Femi Falana, SAN, on Tuesday blasted Governor Umar Ganduja of Kano State over the dethronement, banishment and subsequent detention of the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, declaring the actions illegal.
Falana on Channels TV programme – Politics Today – declared: “The dethronement, the Banishment and restriction of movement and detention are all clearly illegal.”
Falana further highlighted: “In the first place, the governor held an Executive Council meeting presided over by him and within a space of five minutes, the emir had been accused of executing disrespect to constituted authority, meaning the governor and in the meeting presided over by the governor where he was the accuser, the prosecutor and the witness.” This was adduced to reflect tyranny in the state.
The human rights lawyer argued that the emir was dethroned without being given any opportunity to defend himself.
“As if such violation of his freedom and right to fair hearing was not enough, the governor was alleged to have ordered his arrest and banishment to his village in Nasarawa State.
“You do not impeach a governor and decide to detain him somewhere. He has the right to move freely, he has the right to exercise all his powers,” Falana declared.
Falana maintained that “for sure” the dethroned Emir Sanusi II can challenge the dethronement in court.
Sanusi, himself, had on Tuesday warned Governor Ganduje that if he does not end his detention, he will take legal action against the governor in court.
The former Emir’s Lawyers at a press briefing on Tuesday in Abuja threatened to take legal action if the Kano State government does not release Sanusi within the next 24 hours.
The deposed Emir was on Tuesday moved from Loko Development Area of Nasarawa State to Awe Local Government Area, citing security reasons for the action.
