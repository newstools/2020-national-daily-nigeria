Nigerian Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has announced the third case of the coronavirus in Lagos. The case is reportedly not connected with the index case.
According to the Ministry of Health, the carrier is a 30-year-old Nigerian female, who returned from the United Kingdom on Friday, 13 March 2020, and developed symptoms during her 14-day self-isolation.
Osagie said, “The patient is clinically stable and is being treated at Infectious Disease Hospital, Lagos.”
This development comes after the Lagos State Government discharged the index case – an Italian man – as he is now free of the virus. The second patient has also been discharged.
The Lagos State Government has started the process of trying to trace all passengers and all those who might have come in contact with the latest carrier.
According to Akin Abayomi, the State’s Commissioner for Health, the woman lived with her parents, and so her entire family had been moved to the IDH, Yaba for isolation to see if they would develop symptoms of the virus.
The commissioner said while the woman had been moved to the Isolation I ward for treatment, those who boarded the plane with her would be traced. He said people in the flight with the woman should contact the government for appropriate advice on what to do.
In a tweet, Abayomi offered hotlines that could be called by the passengers on the flight so as to start the process of isolation and if need be treatment.
