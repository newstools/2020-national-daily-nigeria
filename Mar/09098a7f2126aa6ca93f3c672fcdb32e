The national Secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was thrown in panic as the embattled national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, resumed duty on Tuesday after the Court of Appeal on Monday ordered stay of execution the judgment of the FCT High Court which suspended Oshiomhole as APC chairman a fortnight ago. Party sources from the Secretariat revealed that several of the Secretariat staff who celebrated the suspension of Oshiomhole, the court pronouncement and the acceptance to respect the ruling by party leaders, were not comfortable on the return of the chairman. Many were said to be caught in fear.
Some party stakeholders who were on the opposition side were also said to be caught in panic on the arrival of the chairman at the secretariat on Tuesday.
Oshiomhole presided over a meeting with members of the  National Working Committee (NWC) on Tuesday afternoon.
Probably, perceiving the palpable fears and panic, Oshiomhole at the NWC meeting at the APC Secretariat in Abuja, acknowledged that conflict is natural in a party of the APC size.
The returnee national chairman noted that APC is united and not divided and will be used as an instrument for the development of Nigeria.
Oshiomhole was of the view that pro-people political parties often encounter challenges than conservative parties.
The chairman stated that despite the challenges, APC remains strong. He pointed out that he is not a perfect being, however, noted that his sincerity of purpose cannot be denied.
Oshiomhole promised that he is willing to reconcile his style of leadership with that of other APC members to enable them work together.
There are indications, however, that most party leaders cannot still trust Oshiomhole, same with some secretariat staff. They still suspect he may go on vengeance war or would want to fight back after settling down from the skirmishes. It would appear that there is still tension in the party.
