Former Kano Emir Sanusi Lamido Sanusi  in exile has dragged the Inspector-General of Police IGP, and the Director-General of the Department of State services, DSS, to Court.
He filed a suit before the Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday, praying an order for his release from banishment.
Sanusi, the 14th Emir of Kano was taken to Awe in Nasarawa State on Monday after he was dethroned by the Abdullahi Ganduje government.
Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, led Sanusi’s team of lawyers in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/357/2020 before the Federal High Court in Abuja.
Rights activists and other public affairs analysts have condemned the state government for the banishment.
But government officials denied banishing the deposed monarch.
