The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has called for further reduction in the pump price, describing the N125 per litre as ordinary cosmetics measures.
In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party insisted that given the fall of the price of crude in the international market to below $30 per barrel, the appropriate domestic price for fuel should be between N80 to N90 per liter.
The party, however, charged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately reduce the pump price of fuel from a ‘cosmetic’ price to an appropriate price that should not exceed N90 per liter.
PDP said the immediate reduction must be done immediately to ease the economic burden on Nigerians and further serve as a palliative for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The opposition party maintained that any further delay in the reduction of fuel price amounts to fleecing of Nigerians at a time government should rather concentrate on efforts that will immediately ease burdens and enable the citizens to battle health and economic concerns worsened by the coronavirus disease.
