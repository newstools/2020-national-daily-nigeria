Rwandan vulnerable families living in urban centres in the ongoing lockdown are already receiving freebies—food, electricity, and others—from their government starting from March 28.
President Paul Kagame had earlier stated that in his nationwide broadcast a day before when he said his government will do everything possible to support vulnerable Rwandans during the coronavirus containment period.
Rwanda has 70 cases of the pandemic confirmed so far.
Three districts of Kigali, the nation’s capital, are already covered, according to the Standard Daily Times.
He ordered door-to-door free distribution of the food by local government officials under his direct supervision to avoid irregularities.
The food relief is being drawn from the country’s National Strategic Grain Reserve under the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources which is used in case of food shortage.
Many citizens have also willingly made their contributions to help their vulnerable neighbors.
The local government authorities are planning to cover secondary cities as well.
“The cities were prioritized because they are the most affected by the lockdown,” an official was quoted by the newspaper.
Kagame, the fourth president of Rwanda, has been in office since 2000.
President Muhammadu Buhari also declared a 14-day lockdown in Lagos and Abuja in his nationwide broadcast March 30, announcing palliatives for those already covered in the Social investment Programme, and promising more for city dwellers.
A federal lawmaker, however, urged him to intervene in utilities like power and water.
“Though these amenities are private sector driven, we urge the government to intervene and ameliorate the sufferings of the people,” said Hon. Shehu Koko (APC-Kebbi)
