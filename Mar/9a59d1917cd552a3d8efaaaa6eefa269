Former Super Eagles captain and former Chelsea midfielder, John Obi Mikel has parted ways with Turkish Super lig club, Trabzonspor by mutual consent, the club announced on Tuesday, National Daily learnt.
This comes only 3 days after the 32-year old voiced his displeasure at being forced to play football (Turkish leagues remain active) during the global coronavirus outbreak.
Mikel joined the Turkish league leaders on a free transfer in the summer of 2019 and will now be a free agent for the remainder (if there is one) of the 2019/2020 season.
