Barcelona to ask for financial help from their players to make up for coronavirus losses.

The Barcelona board will meet remotely on Friday to find ways to help reduce the impact of coronavirus on the club.

With LaLiga Santander and the Champions League suspended for the time being, the Catalan side are expected to lose millions of euros.

According to La Vanguardia, the club’s board will ask members of Quique Setien’s squad to help them out financially.

Barcelona’s budget of 61 million euros this season has been spent on new signings, while 507 million euros is being spent on player wages and 135 million on debt repayments.
