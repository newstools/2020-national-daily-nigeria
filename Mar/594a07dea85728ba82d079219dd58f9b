Boko Haram terrorists in an attack on Dapchi, Yobe State, on Wednesday, killed at least eight police officers. Residents of the community lamented that there was no presence of military personnel at the time of the attack by the Boko Haram terrorists. Military checkpoint was said to have been abandoned as officers tried to avoid the terrorists for their own safety. The space was, therefore, said to be open for the terrorists to wreak havoc on the community, burning houses.
Residents of Dapchi was said to have confirmed that the insurgents burnt police armoured vehicle and cart away one hilux vehicle belonging to vigilante group.
The terrorists were said to have also set Dapchi Divisional police station alongside the military formation base in the community ablaze.
The military spokesman in Yobe State, lieutenant Chinonso Policarp, had said the situation was under control, urging residents to go about their normal activities.
