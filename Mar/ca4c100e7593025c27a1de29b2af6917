The embattled National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, on Friday relatively regained ground in the party after the judgement of the Federal High Court, Kano, which nullified his suspension by the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Abuja, which he followed up with an immediate visit to the State House, Abuja, to hold an urgent meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. Oshiomhole after the meeting with the president, used the opportunity to fight back against his opponents over his suspension as national chairman.
The embattled APC chairman may have stunned Nigerians when in a media interaction at the State House, Abuja, after the meeting with President Buhari, paradoxically exonerated his political rival in Edo State, Governor Godwin Obaseki, from his ordeal in the past 72 hours, hanging the blame on some APC chieftains outside Edo State. Oshiomhole may have unconsciously or pretentiously exonerated the Edo governor from the warlords battling to unseat him, probably, to hype the crisis for greater sympathy.
Oshiomhole interacting with State House Correspondents, Abuja, after the meeting with President Buhari on Thursday evening, following the judgment of the Federal High Court in Kano which ordered his resumption of office, the embattled chairman noted that efforts by APC stakeholders he described as ‘blacklegs’, will not succeed. He accused his opponents of holding membership card of other opposition parties.
The embattled chairman was of the view that some ministers and APC governors want him out of office; and therefore, declared that only God can determine how long he would lead the ruling party.
