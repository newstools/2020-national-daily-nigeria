Actress Toyin Abraham seems to have a bit more than she could chew when she followed the crowd to share a tweet of Davido that went viral on the social media earlier in the week.

Davido who once in a while get inspired to share deep quotes had shared a quote on forgiveness “Make that call, send that text, forgive that person, tell them you miss them. Let go of that grudge, show more kindness. Don’t take it for granted because tomorrow is not promised”

The tweet had quickly spread like wildfire as top celebs posted the tweet on their pages, Toyin Abraham had also done the same but some of her fans had grabbed the opportunity to ask her about some of her sour relationships.

“Have you called Adeniyi Johnson?” some asked…

“Have you called Lizzy Anjorin?” Others berated the actress telling her to practice what she preaches.

Toyin and her ex hubby have been less than civil towards each other since their divorce while Toyin and actress Lizzy Anjorin recently fell out shortly after Toyin had her child.

Meanwhile, a fan simply asked “And have you also tried it?” To which Toyin replied “Yes ma’am I have, i dong have to announce on social media”

Who do you think she made up with? Johnson or Lizzy?
