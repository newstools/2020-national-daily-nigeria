Young Nollywood actress and billionaire wife Regina Daniels has dared Peter Okoye of defunct music group P-Square. Regina shared a video of Peter making an advert of how he will give some selected fans of his the opportunity to take whatever they want from Shoprite within a specific time.

Reacting to the video, Regina Daniels asked Peter Okoye not to try her as she can empty the whole Shoprite in just 30 seconds.

According to the young actress, 1 minutes is even too much for her as she can do that in only 30 seconds.

She wrote “Peter don’t try me oh!
“1minute too much’ just give me 30seconds I will empty Shoprite! Can you imagine?

“First his closet, now you get a chance to raid Shoprite! Do you have what it takes?”
