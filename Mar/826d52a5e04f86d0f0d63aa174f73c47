This is what he said:
Fela is a big inspiration to my music, he is a very musical person I like, he started a whole sound, his own sound even when it’s not making sense but this music is still there generation to generation we still listening to his music, we still value his music, he is a great guy and what he stood for and what he use his music to do is like passing a really serious message to the politicians on how they should treat the people. Fela kuti and Bob Marley are the two people that inspired me.
“Like some people do say Nigeria songs are known to last for a month or two and it fade off. If this is true about Nigeria songs why then fela music still play till today and people still refer to it as the best”.
