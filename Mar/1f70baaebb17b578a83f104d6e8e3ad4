There is rising tension in Kano metropolis over the dethronement of Emir Muhammad Sanusi II on Monday by the Kano State government.
Immediately after the announcement of the dethronement of the Emir, by the Secretary to the Kano State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, at the State Executive Council meeting on Monday, people were seen gathering in groups discussing the action of the government.
Our contacts from Kano said that people are not happy with the action of the government.
Security operatives were said to have been deployed to sensitive areas in Kano metropolis and the suburbs to be on red alert against any mass protest or violent outburst over the dethronement of Emir Muhammad Sanusi II by the state government.
Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State had on Monday explained that the Kano State Executive Council (SEC). after wide consultations in the state dethroned the Emir for breach of Emirate laws.
Government House sources told National Daily in a telephone conversation that the Kano State Governor explained that the State Executive Council (SEC), which the Governor heads and appointed the members, reached the decision to dethrone Emir Muhammad Sanusi II after considering his breaches of the Kano Emirate Council laws. He noted that allowing Sanusi to continue will destroy the dignity of the royal throne that was built over 1,000 years ago.
The dethroned Emir Muhammad Sanusi, the Kano State Government said, was disrespectful to the state government. He was also accused of being deeply partisan when he was expected to be father to all.
Emir Muhammad Sanusi II is expected to carry the calabash – go on exile – after his dethronement; and would be vacating Kano for another destination for the rest of his life.
