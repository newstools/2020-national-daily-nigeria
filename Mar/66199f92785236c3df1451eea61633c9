The embattled national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, can now breath the air of relief as President Muhammadu Buhari and APC governors on Monday decided to postpone the NEC meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
Hours to the meeting, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the postponement of the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the All Progressive Congress (APC) earlier scheduled for Tuesday.
Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, told State House correspondents that the president agreed to their request for the postponement of the meeting.
Bagudu said the meeting will hold when the governors are able to resolve the present crisis.
The announcement was made after the APC governors met with President Buhari earlier on Tuesday to dialogue on the troubling conflicts  in the ruling party.
The meeting, which started at 3 00pm, took place behind closed doors inside the president’s office.
President Buhari and the APC governors in their decision to postpone the NEC meeting saved Oshiomhole from the trauma of his removal. A Federal High Court sitting in Maitama, FCT, Abuja, had ion Monday granted an interim order permitting Victor Giadom to oversee the affairs of the APC as acting chairman and to preside over all National Executive Council meetings of the APC, including the canceled NEC meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the APC governors will now seek ways to resolve the conflicts in the party before the NEC meeting holds. The relief has saved Oshiomhole from the humiliation that would have befall him on Tuesday at the NEC meeting.
