One of the biggest movies awards in Africa, Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards took place yesterday with some of your favourite and controversial actress missing in action.



Though the reasons for their absence has not been verified , but two things comes to mind when celebrities fail to turn up for events like AMVCA which happens to be one of the biggest awards ceremonies of the year. The reasons could be either they had a busy calendar which involves work or business and secondly, they aren’t happy with the organisers of the award.

Someone like Genevieve Nnaji Genevieve has always been a no-show at most events. It didn’t come as a surprise when she didn’t show up this time. It would be nice to see the 40 year old shock fans and critics by attending the AMVCA.

Chioma Akpotha, Omoni Oboli were also absent at the AMVCA and we kind of figured out why they were absent is because they are presently busy on a movie set. Any other reason apart from this is unknown to us.

In the case of controversial actress Tonto Dikeh, we think she didn’t show up to the award because she has been absent from her acting career for a while now. I mean when last was Tonto Dikeh seen in a movie? When last was she called for even a small part in a movie. I am sure this answers the question why Tonto shunned the event.

One of the reasons we think Bobrisky wasn’t present to slay on the red carpet is because he did not get an invite. Would the self claimed male barbiedoll have been addressed to as a he/she on the red carpet? The best way to have avoided this was for him to stay back at home.

Other Nollywood stars that were absent include Ini Edo, Uche Jumbo, Ufuoma Mcdermott , Rita Dominic, RMD,Dayo Amusa and lots more. However, some of them congratulated their colleagues on their wins while some did not.
