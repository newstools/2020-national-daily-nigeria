MTN Nigeria Communications Plc has introduced, “MTN Topit” for virtual top-up services in a bid to get rid of paper vouchers.
The Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Mr. Adekunle Adebiyi, explained that the communication company was supporting the Federal Government in the design to rid the environment of pollution. He said the innovation was to revamp the existing product and make electronic recharge easy for subscribers.
“Paper pollution is a major threat we are facing; what we are doing today is to launch Topit and get Nigerians to know more about recharging without the use of paper. What we are doing today is revamping an existing product; we are in the fore-front to give Nigerians a platform as part of our continuous drive to make consumers’ lives easier, brighter and better.
“We believe in a modern connected world; one in which our customers can get solutions at the snap of their fingers; this is what Topit offers our customers, retailers and trade partners,” he said.
Adebiyi explained that Topit also provides efficient means of recharge for data and airtime distribution across diverse forms of electronic recharge. He added that with improved user experience, it mitigates against any perceived priced distortion and eliminates the irregularities associated with recharge PINS, vouchers, and cards.
“With Topit, MTN customers can buy airtime as low as one Naira and up to N3 million. It is also beneficial to retail partners and potential new partners as it provides ease of entry to start a recharge business while saving the cost of warehousing and inventory management,” Adebiyi said.
