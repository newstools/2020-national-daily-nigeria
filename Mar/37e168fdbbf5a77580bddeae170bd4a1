Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has declared war on bandits in the state, after recent attack caused death of 51 persons.
Gunmen suspected to be bandits attacked some villages in Igabi and Giwa local government areas of the State on Sunday, shooting sporadically and burning down houses and vehicles.
Sources said that the bandits launched the attacks in what seems like revenge against the villagers who they accused of providing information to security agencies.
During a visit to some of the affected villages on Monday, Governor El-Rufai insisted that his administration will not succumb to granting the bandits amnesty. “No amnesty, no negotiation with bandits in Kaduna. I have told security chiefs to go all out for them,” he said.
He assured the villagers that troops of the Nigerian military will be stationed in the villages to provide adequate security.
However, the villagers told Governor El-Rufai that they suspect the bandits to have come from Katsina State to attack them.
