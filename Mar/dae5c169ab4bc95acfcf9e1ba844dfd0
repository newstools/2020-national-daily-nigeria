The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Northern Nigeria, Reverend Yakubu Pam, has appealed to Christians to obey government instructions in keeping to the advice of restrictions and self isolation aimed at containing the spread of the Coronavirus.

Pam stated this on Sunday in Jos, while speaking to our correspondent on the rules set aside by government for worshippers, adding that the virus does not have regard for anyone’s faith or religion.

According to him: “I am appealing to Christians in the 19 Northern States, Abuja, and beyond to obey government instructions, because this virus is not looking at anybody’s face regardless of your faith, belief and colour.

“In Nigeria, if this dread virus spreads to the rural communities it will be very terrible. Let’s help government by keeping to instruction especially in the area of worship centers not exceeding 50 persons”, he said.

When asked if the potency of the virus is one of the signs of the end time, as stipulated in the biblical scriptures, the reverend said it was well spelt out in the holy book.

“These are all predicted that towards the end, we shall see things like this”, Pam said.
