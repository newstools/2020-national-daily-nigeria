Niger state government has brought on voodooists and local hunters to help wage war against bandits killing people, and destroying communities in the Mashegu Local Government Area of the state.
Leading spiritual warfare was 70-year-old woman in Zuguruma, and the casualties, among the bandits, were up to 40 in the 30-minute-long confrontation between the two forces.
It all started when a commander of the bandits and three others who were said to have gone to town to buy recharge cards and other basic needs for the group were arrested and handed over to the state police command.
Approaching the den of the bandits, the woman, villagers said, instructed the hunters to shoot into the air to draw the bandits out.
The bandits were equally said to have returned fire until they exhaust their bullets and the hunters subsequently descended on them and killed 40 of them,” she said.
None of the hunters died.
