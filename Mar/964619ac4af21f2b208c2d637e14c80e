Barely hours after a Court of Appeal ordered a stay of execution of the Abuja High Court’s judgment suspending Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman of the All Progressives Party (APC) on Monday, another court has granted an interim order declaring Victor Giadom, acting National Secretary of the APC, to act as the party’s National Chairman.
The Judge, Justice Samira Bature of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court, gave the order on Monday after listening to an ex-parte motion filed by Mustapha Salihu, the party’s national vice chairman, north-east.
In the motion, Salihu had prayed the court to allow Giadom operate as APC’s acting National Chairman pending the decision of the party’s National Executive Council, NEC.
Salihu also prayed the court for an order restraining the APC and its officers or anyone from preventing Giadom from functioning as the acting chairman.
He noted that Gaidom should be allowed as acting Chairman pending the hearing of the motion on notice.
Justice Bature granted all the prayers sought by Salihu before adjourning the matter to March 20.
Recall that the Appeal Court had on Monday postponed indefinitely hearing in Oshiomhole’s case against his suspension by the High Court.
 
The court later reversed itself and heard the relief sought by the Oshiomhole on Monday evening.
A three-man panel of the court, led by Justice Abubakar Datti Yahaha unanimous granted the reliefs contained in an ex-parte motion argued by the lead lawyer to Oshiomhole and the APC, Wole Olanipekun.
The court also restrained the respondents from further taking any further steps in relation to the March 4, 2020 order by Justice Danlami Senchi of the High Court of the FCT.
