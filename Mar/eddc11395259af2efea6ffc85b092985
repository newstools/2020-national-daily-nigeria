There are reports of several collapsed buildings in Akure, around Oba Ile, Akure as a result of a very loud explosion that happened last night (while many were still asleep).

As at the time of filing this report there was no concrete information on what could have led to it. We are still in shock that no fire outbreak followed the explosive sound.

But some residents of Akure identified the sound to be a thunderstorm.

However, trending on Twitter is a video from an illegal gas station explosion that happened on August 12, 2015 at the Port of Tianjin, China.


Details laterâ€¦
