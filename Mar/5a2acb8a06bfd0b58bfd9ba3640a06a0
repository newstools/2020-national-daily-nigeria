Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has revealed that the Akure explosion, which erupted early on Saturday morning, was caused by a vehicle in a convoy transporting explosives to a storage facility in a neighbouring state.
The Governor, who stated in a tweet, explained that the vehicle developed a fault while in transit along the Akure Owo road. He said,
“Security personnel and other individuals transporting the ordinances noticed smoke from the vehicle. After several attempts to extinguish the resulting fire failed, the vehicle and its consignment ignited causing a massive explosion that was felt in Akure and its environs.
“Presently, efforts are being made to ascertain if there are casualties. Following my visit to the scene, I have directed that the area be cordoned off to allow the explosive ordinance department/bomb squad to extricate the vehicle buried underground because it is unclear if there are still explosives that are yet to be detonated. Everything is under control and I will be updating the public on any new developments.”
Over 50 residential, school, church buildings were destroyed by an explosion suspected to be bomb blast in Akure, about a kilometer away from the airport in the Ondo State capital, early on Saturday morning.
