A Federal High Court sitting in Maitama, FCT, Abuja, has granted an interim order allowing Victor Giadom to pilot the affairs of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as acting chairman and to preside over all National Executive Council meetings of the APC.
However, the court’s order may not be implemented as President Muhammadu Buhari and APC governors agreed on Monday to postpone the party’s NEC meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
