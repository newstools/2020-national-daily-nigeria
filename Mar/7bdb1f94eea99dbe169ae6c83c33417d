Several numbers of people have been reportedly killed following an early morning attack on Damboa Local Government Area of Borno state in the early morning of Wednesday.
According to a military source, the insurgents had earlier written, informing communities in Damboa of their planned attack and have attempted to make an inroad on several occasions but failed to take the town.
An eyewitness account explained that for over two hours troops from the 25 task force brigade in Damboa alongside hundreds of hunters and members of the civilian JTF exchanged gunfire with the insurgents.
According to him, the insurgents arrived in more than 30 gun trucks chanting ‘Allahu Akbar’ as they engaged the military who were holding ground in Damboa.
The soldiers were reportedly in position, ready to repel attacks, having been pre-informed of the planned attack by the insurgents
“When they starting shooting people began to run to the bush. The hunters and CJTF along with soldiers engaged them, but it seems they have come prepared until the soldiers get air support before the insurgents began to withdraw.” Ahmed Sani a vendor with one of the NGO’s supplying food to displaced persons in Damboa said.
Damboa which is situated between Alagarno and Sambisa forest has been notorious in the activities of Boko Haram since the time of Mohammed Ali, the real founder, who was killed in Damboa Alagarno forest after the sect were displaced and forced out of Kanamma in Yobe state.
