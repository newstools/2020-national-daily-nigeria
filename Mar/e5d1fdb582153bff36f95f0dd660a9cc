The Presidency on Saturday dismissed reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved N30,000 relief package for Nigerians with Bank Verification Number (BVN) to cushion the effect of the coronavirus pandemic.
Recall that the President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had reportedly announced the presidential approval of the package in a statement a few days ago.
“The President announced the relief package to be given out N30,000 to every Nigerian who has a verified BVN account to ease pressure posed by the order to lockdown economic activities,
“The N30,000 relief fund will be given to every Nigerian with a verified BVN account. I am sure the fund will go a long way to help Nigerians stock up their home during the stay-at-home order by the Government,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.
However, in a tweet on his Twitter handle, Adesina said the statement on the presidential approval of the relief package was concocted by “fake news peddlers.”
He said: “Fake news peddlers have concocted a statement, purportedly issued by me, saying FG will pay N30,000 to each Nigerian with BVN, to help them stock up before an impending national lockdown. Not me.”
