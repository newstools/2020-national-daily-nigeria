The Nigeria Police on Wednesday afternoon surrounded the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) after a Federal High Court in Abuja affirmed the suspension of the APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, ordering him to stop parading himself as APC chairman.
Report indicated that the presence of policemen who arrived the secretariat in four patrol vehicles were noticed as the police surround the APC National Secretariat.
Their mandate could not be ascertained. It was not clear whether they were there to prevent Oshiomhole from gaining access to the Secretariat, or perhaps, to forestall invasion of the secretariat by thugs. The disposition of the Police, however, showed that they were there to prevent breakdown of law and order as the APC crisis escalates.
