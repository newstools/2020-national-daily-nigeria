Barely days after the Lagos state government discharged five patients who had fully recovered from the coronavirus, Oyo state government said a patient has also been discharged after testing negative twice for the virus on Monday.
According to Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor Seyi Makinde, the release of the patient was consequent upon the completion of his treatment at the Agbami Chest Hospital isolation centre, Ibadan.
“The American returnee had initially tested negative only for the second test to read positive. The index case had been on self-isolation at a private residence in Ibadan until he was transferred to the isolation centre at Agbami, Jericho area of Ibadan on March 23.”
However, Adisa said that the patient will still be observed.
“He is well and very stable and is now back to his house. The infectious disease specialist will be reviewing him for follow up action,” an official reportedly said.
Adisa also stated that governor Seyi Makinde who tested positive to the virus attended a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) held two weeks ago in Abuja.
“It would be recalled that Governor Makinde was one of the governors who attended the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting in Abuja, penultimate week, where he met with a number of colleagues.
“The Nigerian Governor’s Forum (NGF) had after the meeting advised its members who attended the Abuja meeting to go into self- isolation or undergo COVID-19 tests,” he added.
