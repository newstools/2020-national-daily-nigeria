Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has denied that the shindig for his 90 year-old mum in Dubai, United Arab Emirates was funded from Nigerian treasury.
“For the records, this event was strictly for family members and a few childhood friends for which no public funds were appropriated or expended. Indeed not a single politician nor a legislator was present at the event”, said Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker’s special adviser on media.
Lasisi in a statement denied that the Speaker used public funds to take 300 guests to Dubai for his mother’s birthday.
He said the story was categorically false. On the contrary, he said only the Speaker, his family and a few friends were in Dubai to celebrate the 90th birthday anniversary of Alhaja Lateefat Olufunke Gbajabiamila, the Speaker’s mother.
Recall that reports had on Monday said the Speaker slated the one-week celebration in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, starting from March 2.
According to the report, some guests have been booked for special and luxurious accommodation and that top personalities not slotted into private jets have already been booked for special seats on commercial airlines heading to Dubai.
“Gbajabiamila could be spending well over N500m to ensure his mother gets a befitting 90th birthday celebration going by the calibre of guests that would be gracing the occasion”, it reported
