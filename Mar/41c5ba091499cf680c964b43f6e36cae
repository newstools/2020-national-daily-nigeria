The Minister of State for Labour and Productivity, Festus Keyamo, has linked the Coronavirus outbreak in the world to God’s wrath, saying He allowed the dreaded virus to afflict the human race.
He explained that God intended to use the scourge to redirect humans back to Himself. He added that the reason God allowed the virus was because people have distorted God’s word for their own selfishness.
Keyamo, in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle-@fkeyamo, the minister said beyond the spiritual angle to the scourge that “we must all work and pray.”
The tweet read: “God has allowed COVID-19 to afflict the human race only to redirect our steps back to Him. We have so distorted God’s Word to suit our own human weaknesses and satisfy our greed, even in supposed Holy Places. We should collectively ask for forgiveness & it will all end in praise.
“Aside the spiritual angle to this scourge, we must all work and pray; God can only help those who help themselves. Those our recalcitrant Pastors must realise this. All the directives of @NCDCgov must be followed to the letter by all and sundry before it can quickly end in praise.”
