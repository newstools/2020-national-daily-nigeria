The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declares Coronavirus as a pandemic that is sadly terrorizing the globe.
WHO chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold in two weeks. He said he was “deeply concerned” by “alarming levels of inaction”.
A pandemic is a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time.
Sequel to the ugly development, National Daily understands that Cristiano Ronaldo is in quarantine in Portugal after Juventus teammate Daniele Rugani tested positive for coronavirus.
The Italian international announced he had contracted the virus on Wednesday just 72 hours after he sat on the bench for Juventus’ win over Inter Milan.
The defender shared the same dressing room as Ronaldo and the rest of his teammates at the San Siro, where the game was played behind closed doors.
Now all players from both teams have been forced to self-isolate, with Ronaldo returning to Madeira.

Recall that Northern Italy is one of the worst-affected areas in Europe, and Ronaldo will not be coming back to Turin for the time being.
All Serie A fixtures have been postponed until April 3, but Juventus are – as things stand – due to play Lyon in the Champions League next week.
The tie is set to be played behind closed doors, but now faces an increased prospect of it being put back to a later date National Daily gathered.
Meanwhile, Rugani has taken time to assure his fans of his wellbeing.

“You will have read the news and that’s why I want to reassure all those who are worrying about me, I’m fine,” Rugani said.
“I urge everyone to respect the rules, because this virus makes no distinctions! Let’s do it for ourselves, for our loved ones and for those around us.”
