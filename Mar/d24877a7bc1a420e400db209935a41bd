The solidarity letter former President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote to the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, over his dethronement on Monday may have become a snare to the Presidency as well as the Kano State government.
Days after the letter of the former Nigerian President, the former Governor of Kano State, declared that President Muhammadu Buhari purportedly told Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to dethrone Emir Sanusi II.
The presidency has been battling with explanations, struggling to exonerate President Buhari from the dethronement of the Kano Emir.
Dr. Obasanjo’s letter appeared simplistic, but many consider it to be deep in meaning. Perhaps, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State may have been reinforced by the Obasanjo letter to make decisions that clearly showed his support for Emir Sanusi II, offering the dethroned Kano Emir two appointments in a sequence.  The appointments are still baffling Governor Ganduje and the presidency, according to a source from Abuja.
Meanwhile, Dr. Obasanjo ion his solidarity letter to dethroned Emir Muhammad Sanusi II wrote: “I woke up this morning and after my morning exercise, devotion and my meeting with my staff, I heard the sad and good news of your removal by the Executive Council of the Kano State Government.
“it is sad because it was undeserved. It is good because you have paid the price. My prayer is that God should give you the fortitude and the courage to continue on the path that you have chosen for yourself in the best interest of our country and humanity.
“please accept, Your Highness, the assurances of my highest consideration.”
