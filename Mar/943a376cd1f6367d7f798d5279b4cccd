It will surprise many that the Northern State Governors’ Forum (NSGF) on Sunday wrote a letter to the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, as he clocks 78 years on Monday.
The forum, largely all Muslims except three, through its chairman, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau, congratulated Adeboye for his works amongst Nigerians.

Through his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Macham Makut, te governor described the G.O. as a man of God who is rendering fervent service to God and humanity

The chairman thanked Adeboye for impacting on people’s lives through education, healthcare, infrastructure, empowerment and entrepreneurship using the various outreaches and programmes of the Church.
“The labour of Pastor Adeboye in the Lord’s vineyard over his many years of preaching and evangelism, clearly sets him apart as a vessel of honour,” he noted.
Lalong added that God has used Adeboye to touch lives around the globe.
He prayed God to grant him good health and grace as he continues to pray for the peace and progress of Nigeria.
