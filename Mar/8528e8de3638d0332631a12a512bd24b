Just slightly after the arrest of the young man that posted about Daddy freeze’s son. The number one comedian in the Federal Republic of Nigeria as her is fondly called, Ali baba took to his social media platform to announce his feeling towards the whole action.
He said “So this @dannyyung01… is a paedophile… how could anyone have known? And he even was bold enough to post on @daddyfreeze’s page that he would like to sleep with his son… a minor? If he said anything about #Buharis daughter now… DSS would have picked him up. But to sexually assault a minor is nothing. This Nigeria just dey spoil dey go, we just dey look am.
PS…. he has been arrested”
After the arrest, the fans split into two as some believe that “let who is without sin be the fest to cast the stone” as if that was how people who talk are arrested, no one will remain. One of them made example of Daddy freeze himself and requested that he act like Jesus Christ and let the man free.
Ali baba however decided to comment on this statement by this individual as he says :”Sometimes, I want to believe that some people are not just educated illiterates… but core i7 idiots. How can a full grown man comment on a picture of a 4 year old, that he would like to sexually assault the boy, and some animals are making excuses for such comments.And some other monkeys are liking the comment. Are you kidding me? Have we completely lost our moral values.And if you agree with this sick minds let me know. So I can do the needful.”
However, from the statement, a lot of other users have supported the claim to have the young man arrested.
