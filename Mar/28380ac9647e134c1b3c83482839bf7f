A renowned anti-corruption group, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA Resource Centre), has petitioned the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, urging him to ensure the Federal Government commence prosecution of the former acting Director General of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research (FIIRO), Oshodi, Chima Igwe, who was sacked over false claim of Ph.D. qualification with which he gained rapid promotion in service but could not prove acquiring the qualification.
HEDA in a statement on Sunday, issued the Federal Government 30-day ultimatum to prosecute the dismissed Acting Director-General of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, Chima Igwe, warning the government of legal actions from the group. The group maintained that Igwe committed felony and should face the consequences.
Igwe was sacked following intensive campaign led by Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA Resource Centre) after a string of media reports that the former FIIRO acting DG could not justify his Ph.D qualification  he claimed to have obtained from Universite Nationale du Benin (now Universite d’Abomey- Calavi) in Benin Republic upon which he had received series of promotions and awards. It was reported that the only evidence of the purported Ph.D. for 18 years was an attestation letter.
HEDA’s campaign for probe prompted the dismissal of the former FIIRO Acting Director General by the Nigerian government.
