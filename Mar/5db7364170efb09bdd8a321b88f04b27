Kaduna Gov. Nasirel-Rufai has announced the appointment of the deposed Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II into the board of Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency (KADIPA).
El-Rufai made this known in a press statement posted on his verified Facebook page, and it was signed by Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye.
Sanusi was dethroned and banished from Kano March 9.
“Malam Nasir El-Rufai has appointed His Highness, Muhammad Sanusi II into the board of KADIPA,” the statement read in part.
“The appointment is part of the reconstitution of the board of KADIPA, which is statutorily chaired by the Deputy Governor and has as internal members senior officials of the Kaduna State Government.
“Governor El-Rufai said that Kaduna State hopes to benefit from the profile, experience, intellect, and networks of His Highness, Muhammad Sanusi, who before becoming Emir, had built a solid reputation in global financial circles.
“Malam Nasir El-Rufai said that Kaduna State is honoured to be able to call on the services of a man of such calibre to drive its development.
“The Governor also said that he is confident that the new board, which includes the most senior officers of the state will further propel KADIPA to greater success in attracting investments to Kaduna State.
“He disclosed that the external members have been carefully chosen to further reinforce the investment credentials of the state.”
“Established in 2015, KADIPA has led the investment drive of the state and anchored implementation of the Ease of Doing Business Charter that earned Kaduna State World Bank recognition as the Number One place for doing business in Nigeria,” the statement added.
