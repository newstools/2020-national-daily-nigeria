A massive explosion which rocked Lagos on Sunday morning has led to the destruction of houses in different parts of the state.
According to eyewitness reports, many residents were awakened from sleep by the loud explosion caused by pipeline explosion in the FESTAC area of Lagos.
Some of them even scampered after hearing the loud explosion, out of fear that it was a bomb blast.
Videos on Twitter show thick black clouds billowing from the scene of the accident. At least, this is the second major pipeline explosion that has rocked Lagos since the beginning of 2020.
Residents of Surulere, Ijegun, Ikotun, Egbeda, Abule Ado, Okota, Isheri Olofin, FESTAC, Satellite Town said they were affected by the explosion.
“The roof of our building is off and a nearby school is on fire,” a FESTAC resident told TheCable over the phone.
A resident of Egbeda said: “I was relaxing in the sitting room after returning from the church. Suddenly, I heard a loud bang and the doors shook like they were going to fall.”
The cause is yet to be known but an official of the Lagos State Emergency Management Authority (LASEMA) explained that a pipeline exploded around Abule Ado in Amuwo Odofin local government area of the state.
The Federal Fire Service tweeted that its men are making efforts to get information on the incident.
“We are in touch with our men in Fire Stations around Badagry and Festac, we are trying to gather more information as regards the reported explosion in Lagos State, Nigeria. We are on it,” the service tweeted.
It is not exactly clear, at this point, if there were any casualties involved in the tanker explosion.
