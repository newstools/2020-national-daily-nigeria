Embattled APC chairman Adams Oshiomhole shelved his labour-union tactics, and limbered up as he presided over the party’s NWC meeting going on in Abuja Tuesday.
Essentially, he ate the humble pie.
“My style is my style but I’ve learnt to reconcile my style with the style of others,” he told the 21-member committee, adding that none of them wants the APC divided.
“Party Politics is about contestations. I am not the best chairman in the world and I don’t claim to be so, you can fault my style but you cannot fault my sincerity.”
He even held his rival Victor Giadom who wanted to supplant, telling him the APC is never divided.
And, for that moment, the committee was equally calm, watching Oshiomhole as he tactfully steered the meeting from discussing the vexed issue of replacement—to coronavirus.
“If it is one hour that we spend here, let us have a conversation around this issue,” he said.
Dulling any aggressive behavior during the meeting, Oshiomhole chipped in his opinion about the measures Nigeria has yet to take on the pandemic.
He wondered, out loud, how other countries are shutting the land and air borders, but Nigeria hasn’t.
