The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has widened the permissible activities of Micro Finance Banks (MfBs) to include the issuance of commercial papers (CPs) and appointment of agents under the Agency Banking Model.
The CBN also said that MfBs can now invest in money market instruments including Nigerian Treasury Bills (TBs) and access intervention funds.
The apex bank disclosed this, on Wednesday, in the Exposure Draft of the Revised Guidelines for the Regulation and Supervision of Microfinance Banks in Nigeria.
Explaining the rationale for the revised guideline, the CBN said: “The need to reposition and strengthen MfBs towards improved performance has become apparent as revealed from the report of a recent review of the subsector.
