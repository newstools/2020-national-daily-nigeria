Deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sansu II had nobody to rally round him March 9 the way he had in 2014 when he was enthroned.
His nemesis Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje, even piled up the agony for him as security agents, including the police, DSS, and others, descended on the palace, keeping Sanusi under house arrest, before he was finally chivvied out of the state.
He will probably be holed up in exile till a new emir will be announced.
Ganduje, presiding over an emergency Executive Council Meeting, would be announcing the new emir soon.
Chances are the governor will announce Emir of Bichi, Aminu Ado Bayero to replace the embattled Sanusi.
Sanusi lost out because of his disrespect for constituted authorities and abuse of his traditional office.
