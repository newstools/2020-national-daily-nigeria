US President Donald Trump is making tough decisions as Corvid-19 ravages his country, and the nation’s health system caves in.
Trump has lifted visa ban, a policy he made as early as he became president—a president who wanted blacks and Muslims sponging on America to return to, or stay back in, their “shit holes”.
The government in a statement published on www.travel.state.gov on Friday, the Trump administration invited foreign medical professionals who want to work abroad to apply for work visas, and those already in the US to consult with their sponsors to extend their programmes.
“We encourage medical professionals seeking to work in the United States on a work or exchange visitor, particularly those working to treat or mitigate the effects of COVID-19, to reach out to the nearest embassy or consulate to request a visa appointment,” the statement read.
“For those foreign medical professionals already in the United States:
“J-1 Alien Physicians (medical residents) may consult with their programme sponsor, ECFMG, to extend their programmes in the United States.  Generally, a J-1 program for a foreign medical resident can be extended one year at a time for up to seven years.”
Nigerian medical professionals are among the most migratory around the world, leaving their countries in drove in search of greener pasture abroad.
According to the Nigeria Medical Association, 700 doctors leave Nigeria annually.
The coronavirus pandemic has now opened the floodgate for the bold ones among the Nigerian professionals to practise in the US currently the epicentre of the pandemic all over the world.
The World Health Organisation statistics as of 12:00 pm on Friday, revealed that 63,570 people have been infected with the virus and nearly 884 have died in the US which is quickly becoming the new epicenter of the outbreak.
