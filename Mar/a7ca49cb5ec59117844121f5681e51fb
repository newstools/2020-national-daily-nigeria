Nigerian popular Musician Naira Marley has replied a girl who tried to tarnish his image and disgrace him on Instagram by posting a video of them sleeping together in a hotel in Dubai. But the king of the Marlians stood his ground and gave her a no-nonsense reply. He was quick to impress his fans as he gave her a perfect reply.
His reply was hilarious and many of his fans were awed by his reply. He replied ” You cannot make a shameless man feel ashamed”
In his usual manner, Naira Marley did not show any sort of remorse or concern for the backlash he could get as he simply said “Dido Lobo”, which is roughly translated as “Vagina is meant to be f**ked”.
