The embattled National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, on Thursday ridiculed the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, saying it has no jurisdiction to entertain or grant an interlocutory injunction leading his suspension as APC chairman. The APC delivering his counter-court judgment after the Federal High Court, Kano, nullified his suspension by the FCT High Court, noted that he was joined in the suit with other federal agencies, so, the FCT court didn’t jurisdiction to entertain the case brought before it.
Adams Oshiomhole had also accused a serving minister and some APC governors, who he said are desperately seeking to remove him from office.
Oshiomhole insisted that only the National Working Committee (NWC) can vote to remove a national officer who was elected during a national congress.
In the joy of visiting President Buhari after the Federal High Court judgment in Kano, Oshiomhole took to twitter displaying several pictures taken at the meeting with President Buhari.
Captioning pictures he was shaking hands with the President, Oshiomhole tweeted:” Happiness is Free”.
The embattled APC chairman also tweeted: “it doesn’t matter where you came from. All that matters is where you are going”.
Reports indicated that the tweet recorded over 100 retweets, 580 likes and 84 comments, all celebrating the return of Oshiomhole.
