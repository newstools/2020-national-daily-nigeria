The All Progressives Congress (APC) may be heading for lawless showdown over the leadership crisis in the party and the suspension of the national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, on Wednesday by the Federal High Court, Abuja.
In a seeming judicial mix-up, a Federal High Court n Kano State on Thursday reportedly nullified the judgment  of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja, which suspended Oshiomhole as APC national chairman.
The presiding judge of the Kano High Court, Justice Lewis Allagoa, in his judgment on Thursday ordered the police and Department of State Service (DSS) to provide security for Oshiomhole to resume duty in his office.
Justice Danlemi Senchi of the FCT High Court, Abuja, had On Wednesday, granted an order of interim injunction stopping Oshiomhole from parading himself as APC National Chairman.
Oshiomhole had later on Wednesday appealed the judgment at the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, seeking an injunction to halt enforcement of the judgment which the APC already agreed to respect.
Meanwhile, the judgment of the Federal high Court, Kano, raises question of the jurisdiction of the court on the matter, the person who filed the suit in Kano, and whether the court can entertain a case that is already on appeal.
