The Nigeria Police at the weekend apprehended two suspected ritualists – Idris Sule and Alfa Alhassan in Ondo State. The arrested suspects were subsequently thrown into detention pending investigations by the Police.
The Police had disclosed that the suspects were in possession of a human skull and two roasted hands perceived to be body parts of their victims.
The Public Relations Officer of the Ondo State Police Command, CSP Femi Joseph, was said to have confirmed the arrest of the suspects in Ido-Ani in Ose Local Government Area.
The PPRO was said to have disclosed that Sule, a 50-year-old farmer, later confessed to the crime which then led to the arrest of Alhassan, an Islamic cleric, who was alleged to have directed Sule to bring the human parts.
“The suspect confessed to the crime which led to the arrest of Alhassan. An investigation has commenced into the matter and details will be made known to the public soon,” the PPRO had said.
