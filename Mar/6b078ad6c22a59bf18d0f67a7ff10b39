The Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mallam Abba Kyari, led a delegation of the Federal Government of Nigeria to hold a meeting with the Executive team of Siemens AG on Monday on a contract deal of electricity generation, transmission and distribution in Nigeria.
National Daily gathered that Abba Kyari accompanied by the Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman, is currently in Munich, Germany, to meet with the Executive team of Siemens AG. They were joined by the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Amb. Yusuf Tuggar, at the meeting.
A statement from the Office of the Minster of Power accessed by National Daily indicated that  the Nigerian Government recently signed a six year contract with the German company which will result in the effective Generation, Transmission and Distribution of at least 25,000 Megawatts of electricity by the year 2025.
The Siemens contract clearly puts the faith of the DISCOs in Nigeria hanging, particularly, as President Buhari has appointed performance review committee headed by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.  Accordingly, if the DISCOs will continue to exist, they will have to compete with Siemens AG.
The meeting was still going on at the time of this report.
