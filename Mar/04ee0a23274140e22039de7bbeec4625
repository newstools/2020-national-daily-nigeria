The Supreme Court has dismissed the application of the All Progressives Congress seeking to review the judgement on Zamfara governorship election–with a fine.
According to the judgement, the application was a gross abuse of court, frivolous and grossly vexatious.
It awarded N2 million cost against the APC to be paid to the respondents.
The  apex court followed  its initial pattern of decision in an earlier judgement nullifying the application of the APC and its Bayelsa guber candidate which sought a review up the judgement that upturned the victory of the party in the state guber election which David Lyon initially won.
The PDP took over Zamfara in the same manner–when the Supreme Court upturned the APC victory.
