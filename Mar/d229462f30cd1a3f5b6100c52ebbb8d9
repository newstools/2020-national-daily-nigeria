There are indications that the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Right Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, may have been caught in gross panic over raging crisis in the State Assembly which culminated in the suspension of two lawmakers recently.
National DailyÂ investigation revealed that the Speaker has been ruling the State House of Assembly with tyrannical tendencies, turning his office into abode of an emperor. The dictatorship of the Speaker and the desperation for personal gains have recently generated latent disquiet in the Lagos State legislature among the lawmakers.
Sources from Assembly revealed that Speaker Obasa, perhaps, fighting for his survival, on Friday reconstituted nine House committees and appointed new leaders for the committees.
The sources alleged that the new appointments in the House were made to buy new loyalists and weaken oppositions in the House.
The memo of the new appointments was said to be secretly circulated to members and some staff of the House on Friday.
Meanwhile, some lawmakers were said to be waiting for the intervention of the godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, before the House will go on fire.
There are still lingering allegations of corruption against the Lagos Speaker which the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was gathered to have received petitions for the investigation of the Presiding Officer of the Lagos House of Assembly.
