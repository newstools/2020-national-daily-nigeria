Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State on Monday refuted reports that he dethroned the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II. The governor explained that the Kano State Executive Council (SEC). after wide consultations in the state dethroned the Emir for breach of Emirate laws.
Government House sources told National Daily in a telephone conversation that the Kano State Governor explained that the State Executive Council (SEC), which the Governor heads and appointed the members, reached the decision to dethrone Emir Muhammad Sanusi II after considering his breaches of the Kano Emirate Council laws. He noted that allowing Sanusi to continue will destroy the dignity of the royal throne that was built over 1,000 years ago.
The dethroned Emir Muhammad Sanusi, the Kano State Government said, was disrespectful to the state government. He was also accused of being deeply partisan when he was expected to be father to all.
Most of the utterances of the dethroned Emir were said to be offensive to the Kano State Government controlled by the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the former Emir was perceived to be taking side with the former Governor of Kano State, Rabi’u Musa Kawankwaso of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  The Governor was not comfortable with the utterances, the Government House source said.
Secretary to the Kano State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, announced the dethronement of Emir Muhammad Sanusi the Kano State Executive Council meeting on Monday.
Usman Alhaji said a new Emir will soon be appointed.
