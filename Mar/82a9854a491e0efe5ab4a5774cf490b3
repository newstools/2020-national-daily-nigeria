Nigerian songwriter and performer Peruzzi has finally opened up on his relationship with Chioma Avril Rowland, Davido’s baby mama and girlfriend.
Peruzzi, born Tobechukwu Victor Okoh has admitted that knowing Chioma was dating Davido, his boss, was very difficult because he admired Chioma who is a distant relative.
According to Peruzzi in a conversation he had with Tontrends, at the time Davido told him about his love affair with Chioma, Davido supporting his musical works as he promoted his flyers and videos on his social media platform.
He said, “After my mother’s burial; I was going home and someone sent me a message on Twitter, commending my song. The person asked if I remembered her. After she explained who she was, I remembered her. She told me Davido sent my song to her. I didn’t believe it. She further told me that they were dating and she is like my distant cousin, so I didn’t even see it coming.
“I felt like how can she be dating Davido and I wouldn’t know since. She was able to convince me after she sent me some pictures; she told me he was going to be around the next day. She invited me to his welcome party and I went there around 2 am at Club 57.
“Once Davido entered with his entourage, I was scared. He was facing me, but I didn’t know what to do. I moved to see him carefully. He looked at me and called my name. I was happy and I held him. He told me he loved my songs and that I should come to his house. That was the best night of my life. I sent Chioma a text; that I was with him.
“I couldn’t sleep that night because I was too excited. She (Chioma) is my mother’s cousin’s daughter. But she is my cousin; that is how we refer to each other. I don’t have a proper contract with Davido; he is my guy so I am not worried about that. Some people have lived with him for years without any contract.” Peruzzi narrated.
