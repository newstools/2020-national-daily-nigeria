Emir Muhammad Sanusi II, Emir of Kano, has gone down in history when he was dethroned on Monday by the Kano State Government. Sanusi II was dethroned as the 14th Emir of Kano by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje.
History holds that Sanusi’s grandfather, Sir Muhammadu Sanusi I, who identity the dethroned Sanusi II replicated on his coronation, was dethroned as the Emir of Kano in 1963.
Emir Muhammad Sanusi I, grandfather of the dethroned Sanusi II, was dethroned 57 years ago over perceived power tussle between him and his distant cousin, Sir Ahmadu Bello, who was the Sardauna of Sokoto.
Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, had set up a panel of investigation which recommended Emir Sanusi Ist dethronement to Sir Kashim Ibrahim, the then Governor of Northern Region.
Governor Abdulahi Ganduje of Kano State may have drawn current from the dethronement of the grandfather of Emir Sanusi II, former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) – 2009 to 2014, to enforce his dethronement on Monday over offences the state government considered as disrespectful to the government.
History recorded that the late Emir Sanusi I was asked where he would want to go into exile and he opted for Azare, old Bauchi State.
Meanwhile, the exile destination of the dethroned Emir Sanusi II is still being awaited.
