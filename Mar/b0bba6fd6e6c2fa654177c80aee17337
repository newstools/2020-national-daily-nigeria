The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has commenced the process of arraigning the former Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita on allegations of impropriety.
The Commission took Oyo-Ita to the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday morning, where she was arraigned along with eight others before Justice Taiwo Taiwo.
Oyo-Ita was fired after President Buhari won his second term election in 2019. She was known to have a brawl with the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, at a Federal Executive Council (FEC), at the State House, Abuja. it is obvious that Oyo-Ita is paying for her boldness to confront Abba Kyari in the public. She was retired compulsorily, accused of corruption and currently, being prosecuted.
The appearance in court this Monday with the EFCC was an elementary trial process.
