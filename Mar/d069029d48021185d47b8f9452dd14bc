The traditional ruler of Loko, Nasarawa state, where Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammad Sanusi II stayed a night before moving to Awe, has revealed the mood of his august visitor is way different from his angry supporters spoiling for war.
Abubakar Ahmed Sabo said that Sanusi is not disturbed by the dethronement and has made contacts and congratulated the new Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero on his ascension of the throne.
“In fact he slept very well and accepted the dethronement as his destiny. He even said that he will not challenge his dethronement in court.  said Sabo in an interview with the BBC Hausa Service on Wednesday.
But rights activists, including Lagos lawyer Femi Falana, and rights bodies like the Amnesty International, have been doing legal fireworks on the illegality of the dethronement and banishment.
Sanusi, however, seems okay without them
“He told the people to support the new Emir, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero. In fact, he sent a text message congratulating the new Emir,” said Sabo.
“Sanusi advised traditional rulers to know the way to relate with politicians, because there is nothing that brought this dethronement except politics.
On why Sanusi was relocated from Loko to Awe after one night in the village, Sabo said the deposed emir is too big to stay in a place like Loko, which lacks social amenities.
“He is a high ranking personality and supposed to be under the air conditioner, but we don’t have electricity to give him that.”
But the Loko monarch was happy that Sanusi’s ordeal brought the ghostly village on the world map.
“We are happy … of all the cities in Nigeria, it was Loko that was chosen for him to come to,” he said.
Gov Abdullahi Ganduje government deposed Sanusi on Monday, claiming the monarch was disrespectful and corrupt.
