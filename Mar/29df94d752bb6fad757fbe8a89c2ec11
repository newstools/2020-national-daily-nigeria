Security report released by the Nigerian Police for the months of January and February 2020 shows that Kaduna State is the most violent and insecure state in Nigeria where human life is most vulnerable. The state recorded the highest number of victims of violent crimes in the country, according to the death toll statistics for January and February 2020.
The Nigeria Police which derived statistics of insecurity on the total death toll during the period under review from the Nigerian Security Tracker indicated that a total of 690 deaths were recorded. Kaduna State tops the death toll with 299. Borno State, the war theatre of Boko Haram terrorists, followed with 141 death toll then, Katsina State with 64 death toll indices; Edo State has 27, Rivers State 24, Delta recorded 20 deaths, Zamfara State 18, Plateau State 13, Lagos State 11, Niger State 10, Yobe State 10, Ondo State 9, Bayelsa State 7, Benue State 7, Ogun State 5, Kogi State 5, Abia State 4, FCT 4, Anambra State 3, Taraba State 3, Adamawa State 2, Imo State 2, Ebonyi State 1 and Oyo State 1.
These are victims of violent crimes in the listed states.
However, the statistics captured 23 states and the FCT: excluding 13 states. It will not be proper to assume that the 13 state have no incidence of violent crime or records of deaths. Apparently, these states cannot be assumed to be peaceful or most peaceful states in Nigeria. Perhaps, further details will be expected from the Nigeria Police or the original source of the statistics the Police relied on.
Efforts are being made to reach the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, for further clarifications on this report.
