Counsels to Muhammadu Sanusi II who Kano Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje deposed on Monday have stated the court will reverse the dethronement whenever their client approaches it for justice.
Abubakar Mahmoud (SAN) Monday evening that the removal was no surprise looking at the long-drawn-out battle between the emir and the state.
“We were so much embarrassed at the manner in which it was done without giving him any fair hearing or observing any due process,” said Mahmoud on Channels TV Monday evening.
“We are going to be in touch with him to discuss which line of action to take as his lawyers. And we as lawyers, of course, we believe that this action was illegal and unconstitutional.”
Mahmoud also said banishment, under the constitution, does not allow such deprivation as Sanusi will face.
The deposed emir will stay under house arrest for as long as the banishment lasts, according to the emirate tradition. 
This will be challenged.
“The next line of action would depend on the instruction from the Emir. There are two aspects to it – the dethronement and the banishment. We will be consulting with him,” he said.
But as of the time the state took him into custody, Sanusi had not told his lawyers what next to do.
