The Supreme Court of Nigeria on Tuesday resumed hearing on the review suit  brought by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Emeka Ihedioha, on the judgment of the governorship election in Imo State which unseated the PDP elected governor to declare Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner and governor-elect of the state. The proceedings of the suit on Tuesday was full of drama at the counsel to Ihedioha, Kanu Agabi, made argument for the judgment to be set aside. This led to the response of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammed, of what happens if the Supreme Court sets the judgment aside. Agabi, then, demanded that the judgment of the Court of Appeal would be upheld and Ihedioha restored as Imo State Governor.
Counsel to Hope Uzodinma, Damian Dodo, argued on technical issues, urging the court to dismiss the application for lack of merit.
The court will deliver judgement at 3.00pm later this Tuesday.
