The embattled National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, stormed the party’s Secretariat in Abuja on Tuesday after his survival from the moves to oust him from office. The survivor national chairman returned to the secretariat in ecstasy and high spirit after weeks of being locked out of the Secretariat following his suspension by the FCT High Court, Abuja. The Tuesday resumption was the first appearance of Oshiomhole since his suspension a fortnight ago by an Abuja High Court.
The Court of Appeal had on Monday, ordered a stay of execution of the high court’s judgment, thus, reversing Oshiomhole’s suspension. This, perhaps, occurred after the APC governors had resolved to postpone the Tuesday NEC meeting where Oshiomhole’s removal would have been effected. The APC governors had consulted with President Muhammadu Buhari to postpone the NEC meeting while they intervene in the crisis ravaging the ruling party.
The APC National Working Committee (NWC) met the moment Oshiomhole arrived the Secretariat.
Other APC NWC members were at the Secretariat to welcome Oshiomhole.
