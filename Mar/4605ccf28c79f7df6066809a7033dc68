A  man identified as Peter David got so raunchy he was drilling a nanny-goat in an uncompleted building in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State’s capital.
According to a video shared online, David, arrested, confessed to residents of the area he had been a serial rapist of female goats, starting as far back as when lived in Akure, Ondo.
Recounting his last bestial session, David said, “When I saw the goat, I chased, caught and brought it to this uncompleted building to sleep with it.”
Bestiality is a crime in Nigeria, though animal have yet to secure their rights against sexual abuse by the likes of David.
