The APC National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole has been ordered out of the party’s national secretariat by an FCT high court until the determination of a substantive suit a party member  Ouwole Afolabi brought against him Jan 16.
Justice Danlami Senchi gave the order following an application of interlocutory injunction asking the court to suspend Mr Oshiomhole, having been suspended as a member of the APC by the party in Edo State.
Oshiomhole and the APC are joined in the suit.
The applicant, through his lawyer, contended that Oshiomhole is currently suspended by the party and has not challenged the suspension.
He added that the chairman’s rights as an APC member are currently curtailed, and he cannot continue to act as chairman of the party.
In his ruling on Wednesday, Justice Senchi held that the first and second respondents wrongfully kept Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the party.
The judge order him to stop parading himself as the chairman of the APC, and that party should stop to recognizing him as chairman.
Oshiomhole has been battling opposition from his home state Edo where his successor successfully mobilized members at the ward level to suspend the former governor.
