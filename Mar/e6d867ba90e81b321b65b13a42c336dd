The Uruguayan says: Messi opened doors for me when I arrived at Barca. He also highlights the importance of being friends both on and off the pitch.
Luis Suarez discussed his close ties with Lionel Messi in Wednesday’s interview with Otro.

He said: “Messi is a friend who opened doors for me when I arrived at the club. And, besides being friends professionally, we are friends off the pitch. And I think that in order to get along on the pitch, it’s important to get along off the pitch too. And I think what has left a mark on both of us as teammates is the word ‘friends’.”

Suarez has been at Barcelona since the summer of 2014. He has already become the club’s legend. The Uruguayan has scored 191 goals in 270 matches for the Catalan giants. He is now Barca’s fourth-best goalscorer, only behind Ladislao Kubala, Cesar and Leo Messi.

Sadly, the 33-year-old hasn’t been able to help his side during the last two months. Suarez underwent knee surgery on January 12. He could still return in action in late April.
