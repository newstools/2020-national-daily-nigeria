The embattled national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, may be in for fresh trouble in the conflicts ravaging the ruling party. The judgement of the Federal High Court, Kano, has become questionable and the presiding judge, Justice Lewis Allagoa, dragged to the National Judicial Council (NJC) for investigation.
A legal practitioner, Andrew Emwanta, has sent a petition to the NJC against Justice Lewis Allagoa of the Federal High Court In Kano, for alleged misconduct as a presiding judge.
The lawyer is accusing Justice Allagoa to have on Thursday hurriedly set aside the judgement of a court of coordinate jurisdiction, the FCT High Court, Abuja, which ordered Oshiomhole to stop parading himself as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC); upholding the suspension of the chairman by his Ward in Edo State.
Emwanta in the petition to the NJC, argued that the interim order by Justice Allagoa was hurriedly granted in favour of the defendants in the suit, less than 24 hours after Oshiomhole was stopped by an injunction from Justice Danlemi Senchi, from parading himself as the APC National Chairman. This is more so since Oshiomhole has already filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal, Abuja, which is still pending while the Kano judge assumed jurisdiction on the suit.
The petitioner, Emwanta, demanded proper investigation of Justice Allagoa on the hasty judgment, and where necessary apply sanction, if indicted.
The petition now pending at the NJC questions the basis of the judgement that restored Oshiomhole as APC chairman. There are indications that the findings may affect the beneficiary of the judgement of the judge is indicted.
