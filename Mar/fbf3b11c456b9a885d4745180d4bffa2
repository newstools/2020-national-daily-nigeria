First Lady Aisha Buhari has explained it is only a  precautionary move that her daughter who recently returned from the UK is taken into isolation inside the villa.
Tweeting through her personal handle, @aishambuhari, Aisha said she acted based on the advice of the Minister of Health and the Presidential Task Force on Covid -19.
“Good afternoon Nigerians, earlier today (Thursday) my daughter returned from the UK being among the high-burden listed countries of COVID-19,: she wrote.
“Based on the advice of the Hon. Minister Of Health, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and that of NCDC, she is on self-isolation, not because she displayed any symptoms of the COVID-19.
“Please, I urge all parents to do the same, if possible, as prevention is better than cure.”
