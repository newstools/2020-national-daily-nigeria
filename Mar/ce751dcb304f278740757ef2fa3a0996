The group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over what it considered gross failure in the management of the Nigerian economy. The group also chided the president over disregard for the constitution of Nigeria, and disobeying court orders at will.
HURIWA in a statement by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, lamented that the National Assembly leadership is pliant, inept, cash-driven, unpatriotic and hedonistic. Apparently, the various arms of government have failed Nigerians. The  group, therefore, demanded Nigerians to be vigilant and stand for their rights as stakeholders in the country, and demand accountability and transparency in governance or use civil resistance strategy to protest the rot.
“The damage unleashed on the domestic economy of Nigeria since 2015 by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration is horrendous. It may take a lifetime for the nation to recover.
“But the drive to rebuild the devastated economy must start immediately by the collective decision of the citizenry to halt the deterioration. Speak out and demand that President Muhammadu Buhari and his Cabinet stop depleting the resources of Nigeria,” the group declared.
It also urged the people to demand government to open the books for forensic auditing, arguing that as it is, the Nigerian economy has collapsed.
The group noted that the speedy collapse of the economy will adversely affect the social peace of Nigeria because of the wider implication of deep poverty.
“This is the right time for all patriots to rally round and rescue Nigeria from the bad managers at the central governmental positions,” the group declared.
