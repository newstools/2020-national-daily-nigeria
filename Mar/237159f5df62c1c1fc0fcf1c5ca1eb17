Both the DSS and Nigeria Police have deployed their men to secure the premises, barring even secretariat staff, visitors, and journalist from entering, and the building locked down for now.
IGP Mohammed Adamu met with the two sides on Friday, warning the two factional leaders of the NWC–National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole and his northeast Vice Chairman Salihu Mustapha—to calm down and not take law into their hands.
The unrest became intensified Thursday when Oshiomhole got a counter order against an FCT high court order suspending him.
The counter order came from a Kano federal high court presided over by Justice Lewis Allagoa.
Both factions now have a court order each to lay claim to and resent each time they go to the IGP for protection during rallies and counter-rallies.
Oshiomhole has been battling internal opposition for the better  part of his tenure so far. He’s accused of high handedness and rigidity, which many said led to the APC guber losses in Zamfara and Imo, though the party eventually claimed the Imo victory.
But the former governor said some governors and a minister are after him because of 2023.
