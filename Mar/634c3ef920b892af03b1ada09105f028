The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, at a meeting with top Police Commanders in Kaduna declared that bandits in North West are Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists. He was of the view that the recurrent attacks in the state require new security strategies to contain and eliminate the bandits from their hideouts in the nook and crannies of the northwest zone.
The IGP convened the meeting to review security strategies with top police commanders after the Sunday attack by bandits in five villages in Giwa and Igabi local government areas, Kaduna State, in which over 51 people were killed and several others injured.
