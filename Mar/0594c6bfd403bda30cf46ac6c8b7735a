The Second Republic Governor of old Anambra state, Jim Nwobodo, on Saturday, gave reasons why South-east governors must established a regional security outfit similar to Amotekun, established by the south-west governors.
Nwobodo, who made the call at the convocation ceremony of Ebonyi State University (EBSU), lamented the growing insecurity in the region.
He asked the governors to establish a regional security outfit and ensure that all the state Houses of Assembly in the zone passed laws to back it up.
The ex-governor told the gathering that people in the region no longer go to the farms because of insecurity in their domain.
Nwobodo said “My advice to our leaders, particularly the governors is that they should be bold and take things straight once their conscience tells them that what they are doing is right.
“The job of a leader is the security and welfare of his people. If you must lead, you must secure them, you must show them you care for them and the only way you can care for them is you don’t joke with them.
“There is a difference between being careful and being afraid. I want our governors to work as a team and build unity. I want them to take seriously the issue of security because we had lost many lives and I think that I really like what the South West governors did by coming together and introduced the joint security outfit known as Operation Amotekun and they succeeded.
“All their Houses of Assembly had worked on the bill and they passed it. Now it had been signed into law. I am proud of that. Our own governors think differently but I disagree with them. They are talking about community policing or whatever it is called – community policing has been there before now, community policing will continue to be there.
“What I am saying as an elder statesman is that they should take complete control of the security of our people without clashing with the police and in doing that they should follow the example of the South West.”
