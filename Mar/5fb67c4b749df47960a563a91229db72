Several mobile teams of the Nigeria Police on Sunday invaded churches in Lagos to enforce the low congregation order of the Lagos State Government. The State government had directed that church congregation should not exceed 50 worshippers at a service towards combating the spread of coronavirus in the state.
The police were said to have stormed the Deeper Life Church opposite PHCN office on Iwaya Road, Lagos, on Sunday and stopped the service.
The Pastor was said to be carried away by the Police who dispersed the congregation to end the service abruptly.
