Manchester United may have been given a boost over the transfer pursuit of Jude Bellingham as their closest rival in Borussia Dortmund have reportedly cooled their transfer business.
Bellingham is being courted by both United and Dortmund
The English wonder kid has enjoyed interest from both United and Dortmund in the recent weeks ahead of a proposed £30million transfer switch next summer with the former going all out to persuade Bellingham on a move to Old Trafford from Birmingham.
The Red Devils can now enjoy the scene as Dortmund Sporting Director Michael Zorc has now admitted that the German giant face an uncertain period in the transfer market due to the coronavirus outbreak because Dortmund were still considered favourites to land the young star despite United’s efforts.
“This summer will be unpleasant,” Zorc told German publication Kicker. “After all, we don’t know when to start playing again.
“There is a lot of uncertainty in all clubs. We first have to manage this crisis situation.”
Dortmund are now unsure what their transfer strategy will be in the off-season, which gives United a slight advantage in the race for Bellingham.
