Igbo people are dominating every market in the popular Yoruba cities be it Lagos, Abeokuta, Akure, Ado, Osogbo or Ibadan.
It is not a magic, it’s because igbo people are helping themselves in business while Yoruba man can never teach you about his business.
Yoruba apprenticeship is more than slavery, you’ll pay your Master some money to learn from him, he’ll use you to make money for himself and might even use you as his maid at home yet he won’t pay you anything.
After understanding the work, you’ll still have to pay him again before you can be free to open your own shop but it’s not so with igbo people.
Igbo people will put you in their home, feed you, cloth you and teach you how to do business and do well with yourself… When you have served them for a while, they will pay you money for the service or open a shop of your own for you without collecting any money from you.
That’s why igbo are dominating the market and Yoruba people don’t know what to do about it.
Igbos are buying every landed properties in the Yoruba marketplace and sending the yorubas parking, this can’t end well for Yoruba people.
The average home training Yoruba people gives to their children is to go to school, graduate, search for a job and start a family of your own.
You hardly see a yoruba man who teaches his children how to make money…yoruba are failing in business and it’s not a good thing incase Nigeria divides in future.
