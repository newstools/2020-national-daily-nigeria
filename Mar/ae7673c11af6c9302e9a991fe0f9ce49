The Management Committee of the Nigeria Women Football League headed by Aisha Falode, has sent a hearty congratulations to the newly elected Executive Committee of the Nigeria Women Club Owners Association headed by its chairperson, Mrs Matilda Otuene Onyiloha of Rivers Angels Football Club of Port Harcourt, after their successful elections yesterday in Enugu.
Falode, expressed joy at the fruitful conduct of the elections, a situation she described as the true attribute of modern women football administration in Nigeria, where peace, harmony and professionalism remain the watchword.
Falode told National Daily that the emergence of the executive committee with highly spirited and dedicated members, tells a lot about the modern day women football administration as demonstrated by the Nigeria Women Football League management board in the last two years. This will to a large extent boost the further development of the gender game in Nigeria, at a time the world football governing body, FIFA has decided to give women’s football a pride of place in world football.
“We are most delighted to see Matilda emerged as chairperson of the Club Owners Association, together with Emmanuel Osahon of FC Robo Queens of Lagos (Vice Chairman), Hajia Hussein’s Suleiman
