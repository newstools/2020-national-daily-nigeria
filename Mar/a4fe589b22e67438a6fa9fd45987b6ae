Police believe they are investigating a serial killer after finding almost 300 human bones in a garden during a murder probe.
Wealthy property heir Apichai Ongwisit, 40, is accused of murdering his girlfriend Warinthorn Chaiyachet, 22, and concealing her body.
He was arrested after her body was discovered wrapped in sheets and buried at his home. Police were then tipped off that there could be more victims buried on the land.
As part of their probe, investigators ordered a search of a pond near to Ongwisit’s home, with police divers finding at least 298 human bones in the water on Friday.
According to the Bangkok Post, Ongwisit has admitted to killing his girlfriend – nicknamed ‘Kuk-kik’ – in August last year.
The suspect was allegedly a drug user who ordered his girlfriend to sleep in a metal casket as he did not want her to leave him.
Other reports that Ongwisit had kept carnivorous alligator gar fish in his pond have been rubbished by police divers who said they found no fish.
Police chief Jirakrit Jarunpat said the bones retrieved on Friday are now being examined by forensic experts in hospital. It is not yet known how many bodies the bones belong to.
He added: ‘The investigation has found several women who were involved with the culprit have disappeared. ‘They include his friends, girlfriends and prostitutes.’
