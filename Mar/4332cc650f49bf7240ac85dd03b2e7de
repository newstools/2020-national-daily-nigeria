Reports in Spain have revealed that now ​Real Madrid ​loanee Manu Hernando’s challenge on ​Cristiano Ronaldo cost him his career at the club.

During the last few months of the 2017/18 season, Real Madrid had already missed out on the ​La Liga title but were still going strong in the ​UEFA Champions League.

A routine training session was taking place at the club’s training centre in Valdebebas, when Zinedine Zidane divided his players into two teams for a small-sided practice game.

During the match, Cristiano Ronaldo and Manu Hernando decided to chase a loose ball. The Real Madrid academy product arrived late and his challenge on the Portuguese star resulted in the Portuguese great falling to the ground.

​Marca report that Ronaldo didn’t hide his anger, but the youngster apologised to his team’s main man and the game continued. That was Hernando’s last training session with Madrid’s senior team before he moved to Racing Santander in January this year.

Hernando, whose contract with Los Blancos comes to an end in 2021, made his unofficial Real Madrid debut in the summer of 2017 in a friendly game against Manchester United.
