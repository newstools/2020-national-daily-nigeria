The Police at the weekend uncovered security threat in Lagos when they caught a suspect operating okada in Army uniform to conceal his real identity. It was not clear what the mission of the fake soldier is, but he was operating in the state with confidence, which raised suspicion about his source of confidence.
The Police on Friday arrested the military impersonator who has continued to operate motorcycle transportation in Lagos wearing Army uniform to disguise his identity after the Lagos State government banned okada and keke transportation in the state. The impersonator was arrested at Agege, an outskirt of Lagos metropolis.
Operatives of the Alagbado Police Division on enforcement of restriction order on Motorcycles along Madalashi Bus Stop, Agege motorway, Alagbado, were said to have intercepted the impersonator, Yusuf Bello, a 38-years-old man, from Gwoza in Borno State, on the 6th of March, 2020.
The Lagos Command in a statement narrated that the suspect was dressed in military uniform and was carrying passengers on an unregistered Bajaj Motorcycle.
The Police further narrated: “The suspect usually carry passengers from Apapa to Agege up to Ogun State.
“He was arrested, and the motorcycle was impounded.
“Peers of military camouflage and naval uniforms were recovered from him.
“The suspect was also in possession of fake military identity card.”
