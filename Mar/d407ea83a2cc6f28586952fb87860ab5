the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State on Thursday cautioned the absentee lawmakers elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the State House of Assembly is not the property of APC. The PDP citing media report of Thursday titled: “We’re ready to be inaugurated – Edo absentee lawmakers”.
The Edo PDP in a statement by Chris Osa Nehikhare, State Publicity Secretary, identified Barrister Washington Osifo, the spokesman of the absentee lawmakers, as the source of the media report, warning him that the seats of the absentee lawmakers have been declared the seats of the absentee lawmakers vacant; which presupposes the conduct of by-election in those state constituencies by the INEC.
The PDP declared: “It is pertinent to remind Barrister Osifo that he has ceased, along with his co-travelers to be referred to or described as lawmakers-elect or lawmakers! The Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly declared his seat, as well as the seats of his co-travelers vacant. They should know that the seats are no longer available to them.
“The Edo State House of Assembly is not a property of APC neither are the constituency seats bargaining tools in their political bazaar.”
The PDP maintained that Edo people are too sophisticated for Osifo and APC to treat with disdain and not expect consequences.
“Osifo and his co-travelers are advised to stay away from EDHA as those 14 seats belong to PDP candidates who have rightly approached the courts and argued that the refusal/neglect by you and your co- travelers to subscribe to the Oath of Membership/Allegiance with respect to the affected constituencies throughout the First Session and First Quarters of the 7th Assembly of Edo State amounts to abdication of office,” the Party stated.
The State Publicity Secretary stated: “I can’t reconcile why you think you can still lay claims to being a lawmaker even after the Speaker declared your seats vacant.”
