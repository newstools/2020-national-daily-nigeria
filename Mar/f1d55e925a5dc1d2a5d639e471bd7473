The embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, is fighting assiduously to avert removal from office on Tuesday when the APC NEC holds at the Secretariat Abuja. While fighting back at his opponents, Oshiomhole’s may be raising hope in the decision of the   Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja to begin hearing on the appeal he filed challenging his suspension by an Abuja High Court.
Oshiomhole had filed the appeal after the Abuja High Court presided by Justice Danlami Senchi had granted an order of interlocutory injunction stopping Comrade Oshiomhole from parading himself as the National Chairman of the APC pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit seeking to give effect to the suspension order placed on him by his ward in Edo State.
In the notice of appeal filed om March 5 on four grounds, Oshiomhole faulted the “whole ruling” of the trial court which granted the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.
Among other claims, he alleged that the trial court erred in law and arrived at a wrong conclusion which occasioned a miscarriage of justice when it decided that question that his performance as APC national chairman would interfere with the party membership rights of the first to sixth respondents in the suit, at the interlocutory stage.
Oshiomhole, filing the appeal with the APC as co-appellant, therefore, sought an order of the Appellate Court to set aside the ruling of the trial court.
Meanwhile, the APC NEC will be holding on Tuesday amidst monumental crisis in the party.
The APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has declared his support for Oshiomhole.
