While the Lagos state government seems to expect more recovery in its treatment of scores of citizens that have tested positives for Covid-19, and have been quarantined in the state, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control likes to tread with caution.
The daily tallies of positive, fatal, and recovery cases the state ministry of health churn are clashing with the NCDC in some ways.
According to a statement by the state government, six people recovered from the infection March 27.
“Tomorrow, we are going to discharge six of the (coronavirus) patients in Lagos,’ said Akin Abayomi, commissioner for health. “Our admitted patients will go down theoretically to 18.”
To heighten the excitement, Tunde Ajayi, the media aide to Gov Babajide Sanwo-Olu tweeted about the x-factor in Lagos.
“There’s something Lagos is doing right. Lagos takes the lead.”
But the stat from the NCDC tots up all recoveries so far to 3, including the very first index case, an Italian, and his first contact.
“As at 08:00 pm 27th March there are 70 cases of confirmed #COVID19 reported Nigeria. 3 have been discharged with 1 death,” the centre tweeted Friday.
That indicates that only one patient recovered, instead of the six Lagos boasted.
