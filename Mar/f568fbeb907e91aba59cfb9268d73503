Palace coup plot has been reported in Saudi Arabia. Three members of the Saudi royal family were arrested at the weekend for suspected coup attempt to oust King Salman and the Crown Prince, designated son to succeed reigning king.
There is another suspicion that the coup plot may not be real but a proactive measure by the heir apparent to the throne to intimidate potential contenders to the throne after the exit of King Salman.
Reports indicated that internal sources with knowledge of the issue revealed that a possible reason for the arrests could be a move by Mohammed bin Salman, already the country’s effective leader, to counter potential challengers to his succession after King Salman, who is 84, dies or leaves the throne.
Mohammed bin Nayef and his half-brother, Nawaf, were said to be arrested at a private desert camp on Friday while Prince Ahmed was picked up from his home.
Mohammed bin Salman, identified to be the de facto king, was said to be in charge of day-to-day governance in the kingdom. Reports further indicated that he has been praised by the West for implementing social reforms, while coming under intense caustic criticism for a tough crackdown on Saudis perceived as critics of his policies.
Mohammed bin Salman was also under scrutiny after the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
