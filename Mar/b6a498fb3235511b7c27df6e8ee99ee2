Barely days after it closed all major airports, the Federal Government has ordered the closure of all the land borders as part of the precautionary measure in the containment of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
This measure was announced by Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation and chairman of the presidential task force on COVID-19, on Monday evening.
He also said that the council of state meeting earlier scheduled for Thursday has also been postponed indefinitely.
Recall the federal government had barred international flights coming into Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.
Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in a statement signed by Musa Nuhu, NCAA director general, on Saturday disclosed this.
NCAA added that domestic flights would continue operations at all airports across the nation.
