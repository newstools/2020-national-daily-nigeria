The Turkish Super Lig is one of the few leagues which are still active despite the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease.
Mensah is on the books of Kayserispor and he has expressed his frustrations regarding the matter on social media just like his African compatriot John Obi Mikel.
Former Nigeria captain Mikel has since terminated his contract with Trabzonspor after reportedly refusing to play for the team last weekend.
Mensah has since taken to Twitter to make it known that he is unhappy with the fact that the Super Lig has not been suspended like other top European leagues.
“Life is the most important thing on earth,” Mensah said.
“This is a serious thing happening and they still insist to continue – do they really care about us?” he asked.
The English Premier League, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1, Spanish La Liga and German Bundesliga
have all be suspended.
