A six-week-old baby which recently arrived Nigeria with its mother has a set a new record of being the youngest Nigerian, to test positive to coronavirus.
This was confirmed by President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi, via his verified Twitter page.
Giving a breakdown of that number, Ogunlesi said “3 arrived from the US (2 of them Nigerians, a mother and her 6-week old baby), 2 arrived from the UK (both Nigerians)
“Four of them Nigerians (one a 6-week old baby – youngest victim so far), fifth one a foreign national who came in through the land border — the first case of infection via land border in Nigeria.”
Four of the patients are in Lagos, while one is in Ekiti State.
According to him, “all are being followed up and supported by State Health Authorities and The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)”.
The announcement by the minister comes after the Lagos State government on Tuesday night spoke about the condition of an Indian who was quarantined on suspicion of having contacted the coronavirus disease.
Although details were not given, the Indian man is suspected to be a contract staff of the Dangote group who had earlier shown symptoms of the disease, and was isolated before he was later transferred to the Mainland hospital, Yaba, Lagos.
