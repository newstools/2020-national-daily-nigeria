The Lagos State House of Assembly has been thrown into a war zone, as suspended lawmaker and demoted principal officers were debarred entry into the premises.

At about 8:21pm Hon. Lanre Oshun was sighted having altercation with security operatives at the gate of the assembly, querying why he should be debarred entry but after some minutes without access into the complex he left.

When Oshun was contacted via phone he said he his on his way to Burdillon to seek a redress.

The Deputy Majority leader, Hon Muyiwa Jimoh few minutes after Oshun’s was turned back also showed up at the gate and was also bounced.

However the Chief Whip was spotted within the complex observing the development, information has it that he managed to enter the house in the Deputy Speaker’s vehicle.

There are insinuations that lawmakers are already holding meetings to engender replacement for the deposed principal officers and two lawmakers suspended indefinitely.

According to feelers gathered, the bickering was borne out of the need to trim down the influence of Senator Bayo Osinowo, who was formerly a staunch member of the Lagos Assembly and still maintains a grip hold of situation in the house.
