The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) may have come under fresh pressures to rekindle searchlight on the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Right Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, over allegations of impropriety in managing the funds of the Lagos State legislature said to be petitioned to the commission by some stakeholders in Lagos State. A source from the commission, who sought anonymity, alleged that petitions have purportedly been transmitted to the Commission by some stakeholders in Lagos State, demanding investigation of the Speaker over alleged misappropriation of the House funds in over the past four years into the current tenure. The commission was said to be looking into the complaints before necessary actions could be taken.
Details of the petitions or demands for investigation of the Speaker were not disclosed; the source, however, said that preliminary inquiries may soon commence to confirm the profile of the petitioners and the issues raised; thereafter, the details may be revealed when proper investigations commence. He explained that it is based on the findings from the preliminary inquiries that the commission would ascertain whether there are facts therein, before proceeding with proper investigations. According to him, only at this stage would the details be revealed.
Effort to reach the EFCC spokesperson at the time of this report to confirm the petitions was not successful.Â  We will sustain this effort to get his response in our subsequent report.
