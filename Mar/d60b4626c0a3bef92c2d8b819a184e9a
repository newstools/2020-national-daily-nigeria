Deposed Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II has revealed the hell he went through following his deposition, and those who orchestrated his ordeal.
According to him in his application on Friday , his arrest order, banishment from Kano and subsequent detention in  Awe, Nasarawa State, came from Abuja.
He said Kano’s Attorney General Ibrahim Muktar, and AGFA Abubakar Malami (SAN), instructed the  Department of State Services and police to detain him.
Former Gov. Rabiu Kwakwanso, who installed Sanusi in 2014, said during the week President Muhammadu Buhari was privy to the dethronement.
But Aso Rock denied it.
Following the order, the security agents, Sanusi said, harassed and rushed him out of the palace without his personal belongings.
For transportation, he said a friend of his sent an aircraft to Kano to bring him and his family to Lagos. The Kano commissioner of police, however, ordered him to fly to Abuja in another aircraft without his family members.
The Federal High Court in Abuja, where he filed the suit through his counsel Lateef Fagbemi on Friday, granted an interim order for his release.
Fagbemi urged the court to restore the former emir’s rights to human dignity, personal liberty, freedom of association and movement in Nigeria.
He applied that his client be freed from the detention and allowed to move about in Nigeria apart from Kano in the interim.
He said his client had not been charged with any criminal offence to warrant his detention.
Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the application.
The respondents to which the court order was directed are, the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu,  Director-General of the DSS, Yusuf Bichi,  Muktar, and Malami.
