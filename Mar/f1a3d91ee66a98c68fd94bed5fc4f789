As countries of Africa switch into panic mode in the effort to contain the spread of covid-19 that has killed 69 and infected about 800 on the continent, one of the Africa’s philanthropist and economist has offered some tidbit for both the health of Africans and their businesses.
Tony Elumelu, chairman of Heirs Holding and exponent of Africapitalist likes to ensure African are safe. So he has advised Nigerians and other Africans to avoid rumour mongering and unverified information during this crisis.
“At a time like this, it is important that you remain calm enough to receive, process and absorb critical information before taking any action,” said Elumelu in press statement sent to the National Daily.
“They can cause more damage than the disease if special care is not taken so please discourage others from spreading false information.”
He urged citizens to verify the Covid-19 information first with the relevant government authorities.
As a pillar of the continent’s private sector, Elumelu believes this is an avenue for the much-talked-about private and public sector collaboration.
He warned that the far-reaching implications cannot be quantified yet. Globally, the disease has raised health and economic concerns, amidst others, and a direct hit on Africa, the 2nd most populous continent, could trigger a global nightmare.
According to him, the life of a business might be important at this moment, but human lives are more important.
The business magnate then encouraged Africans to follow the WHO guidelines for governments, institutions, and individuals in responding to the pandemic.
