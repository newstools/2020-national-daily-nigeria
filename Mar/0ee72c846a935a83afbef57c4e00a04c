APC National Chairman Adams Oshiomole was briefing President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday at Aso Rock when the news broke a federal high court in Kano set aside the FCT high court’s that  suspended him as chairman.
“I thought that I had a duty to brief Mr President as the overall leader of our party about this development. Incidentally when I requested for the audience yesterday, I wasn’t sure what has happened today will happen,” he told news men after a meeting with Buhari.
“And I showed to the president the resolutions of my ward even though a ward executive does not have the powers to remove a national chairman. Just to say that the document that we have says clearly that my ward passed vote of confidence in me.
“How the court can hold a vote of confidence and twist it to mean a vote of no confidence… only that judge can explain it to himself.”
He said his lawyers argued it but the judge was determined to bend to those who want to destabilise the All Progressive Congress.

Those who want to destabilise the party, according to him, might not be different from those who want to kick him out of office.
He said among them are a minister and some governors, though he mentioned no name.
Obviously, among the governors is his successor Godwin Obaseki, his estranged godson who has been mobilising Edo against the former governor in long-drawn-out superiority battle.
