Imo Governor Hope Uzodinma, was attacked Sunday afternoon by youth at the Ohaji area of the state.
The youths of Mmahu community began the violence by  chanting, “Onye Oshi Vote, Onye Oshi Vote”. That, in Igbo means “stolen votes”.
They then threw bottles and sticks at the convoy, and the youth also damaged the  governor’s bulletproof car.
The governor could not attend the function he went for at Ohaji.
