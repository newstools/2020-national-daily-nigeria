Barely weeks after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested scores of internet fraudsters, otherwise referred to as Yahoo Boys in the ancient city of Ibadan, another 38-year-old suspected internet fraudster, Azeez Adebowale, has been arrested with a mini coffin containing fetish materials.
The strange objects were seen by operatives when the Yahoo Yahoo boy’s home was raided on the order of Ibadan Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on March 2, 2020.
Adebowale, who claimed to be using the coffin as a soap rack, was among six persons arrested by operatives, following weeks of tracking intelligence tips on their alleged involvement in internet fraud.
A lady, Toyinsola Bolumole, was among those picked up by operatives at locations around Oluyole and Alao-Akala Estates of the ancient city.
Others are Ifelowo Ololade, Sonuyi Ayodeji, Folarin Oladele Olayinka and Aluko Olawale.
