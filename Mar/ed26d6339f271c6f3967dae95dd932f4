Judge orders his release

The dethroned Emir oF Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, has won the first round of the battle in court, defeating the Federal Government and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State over restriction on his freedom.
Accordingly, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Friday granted an interim order releasing the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, from detention.
Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the order while delivering judgement on the exparte motion filed on behalf of the deposed Emir by Lateef Fagbemi SAN.
The judge noted that the order for the release of the dethroned Emir should be served on the respondents to the application.
The respondents to the application marked FHC/ABJ/CS/357/2020 include, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Muhammed Adamu; the Director-General of the Department of State Service (DSS), Yusuf Bichi; the Attorney-General of Kano State, Ibrahim Muktar, and the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN). They are state agents or appointees acting the mandate of either Governor Ganduje or President Muhammadu Buhari.
The judge, thereafter, fixed March 26, 2020, for the hearing of the substantive  suit challenging his detention.
The former Emir had earlier on Thursday approached the court seeking an interim order of the court directing his immediate release from detention.
He prayed the court to order his release from “the detention and or confinement of the respondents and to restore his rights to human dignity, personal liberty, freedom of association and movement in Nigeria, (apart from Kano State) pending the hearing and determination of the applicant’s originating summons.”
Sources from Nasarawa told National Daily that the court order has been served on the respondents this Friday.
