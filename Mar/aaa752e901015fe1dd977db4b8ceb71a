Former Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Right Hon. Adeyemi Ikuforiji, has warned that the Nigerian government, both federal and states, must take the task of preventing and containing the spread of corona virus across the country seriously. The former Lagos Assembly Speaker maintained that the government must not allow coronavirus infection to become an epidemic in the country.
Ikuforiji who came back from the US last week, noted that the infection of the virus is deadly, leading to quick death outside Nigeria.
The former Speaker affirmed that government should not lose focus in controlling the spread of the virus, adding that if it becomes an epidemic in the country, it will cost government a lot to terminate it.
He emphasized the need for stronger collaboration between the federal government and the states to ensure that the spread of coronavirus is effectively controlled in the country. He reiterated that countries where coronavirus has become epidemic are paying dearly for it.
Ikuforiji, therefore, advocated that proper isolation medical centres and other preventive facilities be provided, including adequate checks at the international airports.
