President Muhammadu Buhari, for the first time, has taken the first public decision on the move by some party men to remove Chairman Adams Oshiomhole.
He has now approved the postponement of the APC National Executive Council, NEC, meeting.
Buhari made his decision known at a meeting with the APC governors elected on the party’s platform at the Presidential Villa on Monday.
The NEC meeting was scheduled by some aggrieved members, including a tiny south-south caucus of the party who want Oshiomhole sacked.
