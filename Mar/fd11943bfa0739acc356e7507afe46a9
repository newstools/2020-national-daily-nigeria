Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to the bill seeking the ban on the importation and use of all kinds of generators which passed first reading at the Senate on Wednesday.
The chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who reacted to the bill on his official Twitter page of Thursday, condemned the Senator representing Niger South, Muhammad Bima, for introducing the bill.
Fani-Kayode in his post on Twitter also described Bima as insane for seeking to jail those who sell and use generators in Nigeria.
He ought to be tied up, placed in a strait jacket, put in a strong sack filled with weights and dropped in the deepest & darkest part of the Atlantic Ocean.”
The bill, which was sponsored by the Senator representing Niger South, Bima Enagi, seeks to outlaw the use of electric generators in the country.
Due to the epileptic nature of power supply across the country, many Nigerians rely on generators as sources of power supply in their homes and businesses.
Aside proposing the ban on generators, the bill is also proposing that anybody that imports or sells generators in the country risks at least 10 years imprisonment.
