The SGF noted that reports indicated that there was substantial compliance with the restriction of movement presidential directive, but some citizens which the government seeks to protect were disobeying the order.
The SGF and Task Force Chairman explained that the directive to restrict movement was aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus which has been ravaging the entire world and preventing it from becoming an epidemic in the country.
The SGF said that the Task Force is monitoring developments in the country. Boss Mustapha disclosed that the federal government will soon issue restriction protocol and guideline for exemptions.
The SGF also said that the government is looking at all processes to harness resources, personnel, and facilities to enhance the operational capacity of relevant agencies involved in the fight against coronavirus.
The SGF, therefore, appealed to volunteers, people with experience of past occurrences or present experience, to volunteer in providing services in the fight against the deadly coronavirus.
