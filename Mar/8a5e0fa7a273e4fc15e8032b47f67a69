These 3 big artistes  always reject collaborations with upcoming artistes.

Sean tizzle is a Singer, songwriter and performing artiste who blew up in the industry after the release of his chart topping single “Sho le”. Tizzle is one act who hardly collaborates with big artistes let alone the upcoming ones and the reason is best known to him. He gets a lot of requests from upcoming artistes for collaborations but he’s always turning them down. He forgot that what goes around comes around. Today he’s no more the rave of the moment because he took a break from music and he’s struggling to get another hit song again.

2. Kizz Daniel

Tobiloba Anidugbe popularly known as Kizz Daniel is Singer and Songwriter who is regarded as one of the most talented artistes in the industry. Kizz Daniel is a very proud artiste who collaborates only with artistes who are bigger than him. Many of his fans have criticized him for this attitude but everything they said fell behind his ears. The fact that he blew with his own single does not mean all artistes will blow the same way, Collaborations help a lot.Vado has forgotten that he was once an upcoming artiste who Emperor Geezy helped become popular.

3. Fireboy

YBNl top act Fireboy is a Great Singer and Songwriter who’s voacal skills is second to none. Don’t be surprised he made it into this list as well. He released his Debut album last year “laughter tears and goosebumps” which consists of 13 dope tracks without collaborations. Fireboy is no doubt a talented artistes but ever since he became popular in the industry he has been getting collaboration offers but has been turning them down for reason he doesn’t disclose.
