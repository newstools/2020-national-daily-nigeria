The Lagos government has begun another round of tracing as a new case is confirmed by the state health commissioner.
So all the passenger on the March 13 British Airways flight to Nigeria are to be traced out and isolated as the index case came from the UK .
The affected person is a 30-year-old Nigerian lady.
She returned from the United Kingdom on March 13.
The Ministry of Health says she is now at Mainland General Hospital receiving care.
Health Commissioner Akin Abayomi advised passengers on the same flight with the UK-returnee should stay at home and self-isolate themselves for 14 days.
“Contact tracing of all passengers and all those who may have come in contact with this latest case has commenced,” he said.
Detecting this after four days will pose a lot of challenges for contact tracing as those affected may be unwilling to out.
It nearly became a national security issue for the last two passengers on the same flight as the first index case from Italy to turn themselves in.
The state got them on Facebook weeks after detection.
