Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State may be facing early crisis after the dethronement of the former Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II. The crisis, according to sources from Kano are self-creative by the governor.
Some stakeholders in Kano have complained that Governor Ganduje has thrown himself into dilemma over the four new emirates he created and attributed equal status and powers with the Emir of Kano, the deposed Muhammad Sanusi II.
The four emirates include Gaya, Rano, Karaye and Bichi. Governor Ganduje further appointed  first-class emirs in each of the four new emirates in competition with Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, who was the custodian of the Kano Emirate.
The Kano State House of Assembly had passed the 2019 Kano Emirate Council Bill into law which was signed by the governor.
Justice Usman Na’Allah of the Kano State High Court had nullified the Kano Emirs Appointment and Depositions Amendment Laws 2019 that Governor Ganduje sent to the State House of Assembly. The lawmakers, however, passed fresh bill approved by the State Executive Council as sent to the legislature. The latter law increased the power of the governor to appoint and dethrone an emir in Kano.
Meanwhile, the new Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, was the Emir of Bichi which had equal powers and status with the Emir of status. Now, Emir Aminu has become the Emir of Kano which used to be the paramount ruler of Kano Emirate; there are indications that Governor Ganduje is at a loss over how to restructure the emirates and restore supreme powers in the Emir of Kano. Otherwise, the new Emir Aminu Ado Bayero will be a victim of the weak powers of the Emir of Kano and would have to rub shoulders with the Emirs of the four emirates in the state.
Our sources said the governor is ruminating on how to make adjustments to the situation.
