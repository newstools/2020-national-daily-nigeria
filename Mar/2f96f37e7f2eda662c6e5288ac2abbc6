Chief of staff to the President Abba Kyari was in Kogi State government house on March 17, after he came back from his seven-day stay in Germany.
Kyari went to Munich, Germany, on Saturday, March 7, to meet with officials of Siemens over the Nigerian electricity expansion programme.
He returned to Nigeria on Saturday, March 14, and went to commiserate with Gov. Yahaya Bello who just lost his mother.
There have been reports explaining how the CoS came to be tested. Some said he was showing symptoms while others said he wasn’t.
No official clarification from the presidency yet.
The NCDC media team said would not explain either.
”Please, NCDC has not provided personal information of any case, and will not provide information on a case by case basis. Dr. Ihekweazu stated this yesterday, and we are re-iterating,” said the agency on Tuesday.
