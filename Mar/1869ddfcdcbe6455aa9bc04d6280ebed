Following Bauchi Gov Mohammed Bala’s infection with Covid-19, and presidential CoS Abba Kyari’s, too, members of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) are retreating into isolation, and the bold ones among them are fessing up.
Ekiti Gove Kayode Fayemi tweeted Wednesday that he met two people—Bala and Kyari most likely— infected and tested positive, so he had to take the test himself, and go into isolation while awaiting the result.
“I just took the COVID-19 test having gone into self-isolation since yesterday evening. I’m asymptomatic and feel well but I was in meetings with two people who had since tested positive,” the NGF chairman tweeted on Wednesday.
“I look forward to an all clear and I have encouraged all my colleagues to take the test.”
Down south-south, Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki has equally entered the isolation mode—for similar reasons.
According to his media aide Crusoe Osagie said, the governor has gone into self-isolation after Mohammed and Kyari, tested positive for coronavirus.
“The governor had met Mohammed at the Nigeria Governors Forum and National Economic Council meetings. He also visited Mr. Kyari,” said Osagie on Wednesday.
Obaseki has showed no symptoms of the virus, but has taken the necessary precaution to self-isolate to protect people that may otherwise come in contact with him.
Kogi Gov Yahaya Bello too is in self isolation, following Kyari’s infection.
Others, like Bayelsa Gov. Duoye Diri,  who directly or indirectly related with Mohammed or Kyari are yet to declare their status.
