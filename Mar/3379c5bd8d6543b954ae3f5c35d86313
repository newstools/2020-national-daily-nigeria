There is rising apprehension that the government appears to be losing control of the spread of corona virus in the country as four new cases of Coronavirus infection were confirmed in Lagos on Thursday, bringing the total confirmed cases in the state to 11 carriers.
Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, at a press briefing on Thursday, said tests were conducted on 19 suspected cases from which the four new cases were detected.
This is coming barely 24hours after the state confirmed additional four cases of the virus.
With these developments, Lagos State government now has more than 1,300 contacts to trace and the numbers of contacts to trace are increasing by the day.
Meanwhile, the commissioner stated that the virus has been cleared from the index case, an Italian, but will undergo one more test before he can be discharged.
