Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Monday sent a solidarity letter to the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, acknowledging the misfortune of his removal from the throne by the Kano State government.
Former President Obasanjo noted that the removal of the former Emir of Kano denoted sad and good omen for his personality; noting that it was sad because his dethronement was underserved and good because the former Emir has paid his price.
Dr. Obasanjo’s letter to former Emir Muhammad Sanusi II reads: “I woke up this morning and after my morning exercise, devotion and my meeting with my staff, I heard the sad and good news of your removal by the Executive Council of the Kano State Government.
“it is sad because it was undeserved. It is good because you have paid the price. My prayer is that God should give you the fortitude and the courage to continue on the path that you have chosen for yourself in the best interest of our country and humanity.
“please accept, Your Highness, the assurances of my highest consideration.”
