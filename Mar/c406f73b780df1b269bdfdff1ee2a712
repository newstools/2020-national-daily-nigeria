The National Union of Road Transport Workers, Agege Branch ‘B’, has pleaded with  Rt.Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly (LAHA) to help influence lasting resolution of the ranging leadership tussle in the union.

Alhaji Kamoru Balogun, Treasurer of the union, told the Newsmen on Thursday in Lagos that the speaker has key role to play in ensuring peace reign among the union’s leaders.

“Our union members are peaceful in Agege, no conflict, but the only challenge we are facing now is that of leadership position.

“We want the honourable speaker to help resolve it to avoid undue political interference,” he said.

Mr Olayiwole Quadri, Finance Clerk of the union, said, “for many months now, we have been expecting the state council to give us go ahead to choose our chairman.

“But due to one influence or the other till now, no response from them.

“We know the next person to become the Branch ‘B’ chairman Agege. He is Alhaji Kamoru Adaba.

“All members of the union have given him support up to the state council.”

Commenting, Mr Gambi Olaojo, the union Secretary, Mangoro Unit, appealed to the state chapter of the union to find solution to the chapter’s leadership tussle in Agege.

Also, Mr Akeem Olayiwola, the union Secretary, Mosalasi Phase 2, said: “Most of us have been in the union for many years.

“The leadership position here is turn by turn, and we know the next chairman either by election or through consensus.

“We don’t want political influence so as to maintain sanity among the union members,” he said.
