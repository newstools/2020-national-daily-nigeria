Prof. Maurice Iwu, CEO, Bioresources Institute of Nigeria, said on Monday his team has discovered a cure for coronavirus.
The INEC former chairman said this when he led his team of researchers to brief the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu and his Health counterpart, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, in Abuja.
According to him, the institute identified and patented the possible COVID 19 treatment in 2015. So it now needs the Federal Government’s support to translate the compound into a drug for the treatment of the virus.
The deadly disease hs spread across more than 45 countries, killing over 3000 of more than 100,000 people infected.
Nigeria’s first index case, an Italian, was quarantined in Lagos last weekend. Other cases, mostly Chinese expats, hve been isolated in Plateau.
No fatality recorded so far.
