Following the confirmation of presidential Cos Abba Kyari as being infected with Corovid-19, more of his satff have equally being confirmed infected.
Three of them, at least, are now positive.
The Presidential Villa has since shut down, and non-essential staff have been asked to stay away.
Kyari flew in from Germany 10 days ago, and thereafter headed to Kogi to condole Gov Yahaya Bello. He didn’t isolate himself.
There are fears that the CoS didn’t isolate himself as he attended several meetings and met many individuals.
The number of confirmed cases has therefore run up to 46 with the latest cases.
