The Senate on Wednesday passes a bill on ban of importation of generators into Nigeria through First Reading. The consequence is that prices of generators may rise because Nigerians will still seek generators as alternative source of electricity in the failures of the DISCOs.
The proposed bill was introduced to lawmakers present at Wednesday’s plenary and it passed first reading in the day’s legislative activities.
A Senator from Niger State, Muhammad Bima, is sponsoring the bill titled ‘Generating Set (Prohibition/Ban) Bill, 2020.’
The bill will put an end to importation of generator but this, however, cannot guarantee stable electricity for Nigerians until proper reforms are carried out.
Another bill to alter the Constitution to provide financial and administrative autonomy for local government councils also passed second reading in the Senate.
The bill which is sponsored by Senator Ahmad Keita is one of nine other bills for the amendment of the 1999 Constitution presently before the lawmakers.
Other bills that scaled second reading on Wednesday included the Immunity for Federal Lawmakers for Words Spoken at Plenary and a bill to prevent the Federal High Court from entertaining pre-election disputes.
New bills are not usually debated before passing the first reading. They are merely listed and moved to second reading before comments are entertained.
