A woman, Miss Dinatu Gadi of the ECWA staff community in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau, has committed suicide by setting herself ablaze.
According to a witness, Mr. John Fara, the woman in her mid-thirties, bought a gallon of kerosene at about 8 p.m. on Thursday night, sneaked to the back of her house, poured the whole content on her body and set herself alight.
Fara, who is also a neighbour to the deceased, said that he saw a huge fire burning but thought someone was burning trash.
“I was outside the house when I saw a huge fire behind the compound and thought someone was burning trash. Then I heard someone scream once and said ‘I am dying’, and I quickly went behind to inquire what was going on and discovered someone was burning in the fire.
“Immediately, we brought water and poured it on her, but it was already too late, she was badly burnt all over, but she was still alive. Her family members quickly rushed her to the hospital but was later confirmed dead.
“Only God knows why she committed the act because we all saw her going about doing her normal duties during the day,” Fara said.
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, ASP Ubah Ogaba, said he was not aware of the incident, but promised to investigate it.
“The incident has not yet been reported to us, but we will investigate it to ascertain the cause,” he said.
