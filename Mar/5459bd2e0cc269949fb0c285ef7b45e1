The Court of Appeal, Abuja, has reinstated Ifeanyi Ubah  of the Young Progressive Party as duly elected Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District in the National Assembly.
In a unanimous judgment, a three-member panel of the Justices of the Court of Appeal led by Justice Stephen Adah, held that the FCT High Court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the matter in the first instance.
The appellant had raised issues of territorial jurisdiction, where he noted that the issue brought to the FCT High  relates to election in Anambra State.
The Court of Appeal insisted that the FCT High Court ought not to have entertained a matter which originated from Anambra State. The court, therefore, reinstated Ifeanyi Ubah as Senator of the Ninth National Assembly.
