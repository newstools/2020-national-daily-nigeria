Apart from Lagos where cases of coronavirus are mostly confrmed in air passengers from the US and UK, Ekiti, another state in the southwest, has now got a case to contend with.
According to the federal government, five new cases are already confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Nigeria to eight.
All the five new cases originated from the United Kingdom–two cases— and the United States–three cases.
All the cases were Nigerians including a six-week-old baby–except a foreigner who came in through the land borders.
One them is in Ekiti while others are in Lagos.
