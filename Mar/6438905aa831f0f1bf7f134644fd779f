Here are the compiled list of Nigerian superstars that are out of the country and maybe seeking to return home soon because of the Covid19 outbreak.
Nollywood actress Eniola Badmus
The actress has been in London for the past few weeks. She could not attend the Africa Magic Viewer’s Choice Awards (AMVCA) because her flight was canceled.
Singer Falz
Falz is also currently out of the country. With his newly released hit, Bop Daddy, just dropping. It appears the musician is everywhere trying to distribute his works and do general promo.
BBNaija’s star Khafi Kareem
Former Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) housemate Khafi Kareem is also out of the country at the moment. The last video post on her Instagram page shows her shopping at a grocery store in London.
Comedian Arole
The popular comic act is also in London at the moment. He was sighted with BBNaija star Khafi at a London grocery store.
Hopefully, these individuals will be made to get tested and self-isolate upon their re-entry back into Nigeria.
