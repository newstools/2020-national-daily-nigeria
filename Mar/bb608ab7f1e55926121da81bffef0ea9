Innocent Idibia popularly known as 2face or 2baba released his 10th studio album yesterday titled Warriors, many popular artistes were on the Album in the likes of Wizkid, Burna Boy, Tiwa Savage, and even Peruzzi. But what surprised most Nigerians is that Davido wasn’t included, also Naira Marley. Everybody has been reacting to the issue on Twitter and other social media platforms.
According to some people, they believe 2baba deliberately avoided those Artistes because he felt they ain’t good enough for his Project. While some said, 2face featured songwriters and not just copy and paste musicians.
Can we say Davido and Naira Marley ain’t Warriors enough to work with 2baba? Or were they busy during the time of the Recording?
