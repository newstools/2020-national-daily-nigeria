The dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, on Monday, indicated that he has no regret over the misfortune that befell him after the Kano State government announced his removal.
In a recorded brief statement before his evacuation from the palace of the Emir of Kano on Momaday, Sanusi had acknowledged  that his removal from the throne is nothing new, pointing out that  every power is transient except that of God. Dethroned Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, therefore, declared that he accepted his dethronement as an act of destiny.
He expressed gratitude for the support he git from the people of Kano in his six years on the throne; urging them to remain calm and support the new Emir.
The speech translated from Hausa into English reads:
“In the name of Allah, peace be unto you all.
“We are always thankful to Almighty Allah. God in his infinite mercy made me the Emir of Kano on the 8th of June 2014
“I live in good health for almost six years on the throne. Today, God that has given me the royalty Has withdrawn it.
“We do say this every day that being on the throne has a fixed time and only God knows when your days will expire. Whether you like it or not, you must go.
“So, we have accepted, and we are thankful to God. We would like to thank the people of Kano for the love they have shown to us and loyalty.
“We are also thankful to our disciples and our aides. We call on the people of Kano to remain calm. We wish to plead to you to support whoever emerges as the new emir and show solidarity to him and protect his integrity.
“We thank all our relatives and plead with them to be patient. We are reminding them that God does not make mistakes. What God has chosen is the right thing.
“We also thank God for giving us the opportunity to erect new structures in the palace and renovate old ones. We pray that God brings us even more closer to Him. May Allah give Nigeria good leaders”.
“Thank you! We have left you in peace!”
