All participants at the African Magic Viewers’ Choice Award (AMVCA) held on March 14 may have come in contact with one Lagos confirmed Coronavirus case.
These include Nollywood stars, entertainment journalists, panelists, event organisers, and others.
Professor Akin Abayomi, Commissioner for Health, made the revelation Tuesday afternoon.
“COVID-19 Lagos Alert! I hereby notify you that all participants at the African Magic viewers’ Choice Award (AMVCA) held on 14th March at Eko Hotels may have come in contact with one of the confirmed cases in Lagos and are most likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 Infection”, he tweeted.
A female UK returnee among the stars attended the event while her symptoms were already manifesting.
The commissioner therefore advised all attendees to observe strict self-isolation, maintain social distancing or contact the state if they exhibit any coronavirus-related symptoms.
