There will be no military lockdown of Nigeria on Friday as being reported by some media platforms, as part of measures to contain coronavirus epidemic, the Army has said.
Col. Sagir Musa, acting Director Army Public Relations, described the reports as false and misleading.
The reports were designed by certain mischievous elements to create chaos, panic and disaffection in the society, Musa said.
He said the document quoted was a proactive directive for the Nigerian army to prepare for possible escalation of the COVID -19 based on the happenings around the world on the pandemic.
He said the promoters of the reports had some ulterior motives.
“The misinterpretation that government is locking down the entire country and pulling out the army by Friday, March 27, is utterly false and bias, the NA considers the publication and negative interpretation being given the content of the classified document containing information meant for the army personnel as a violation of the Official Secret Act.
Musa gave the assurance that the Nigerian army would continue to be professional, proactive and responsive in support of the constitution, democracy and government.
He said this will be in line with its constitutional mandate of providing aid to civil authority.
“The mischief of some unpatriotic few will not dissuade the Nigerian Army from working with sister services, the Nigeria Police and other security agencies to keep Nigeria safe”, he said.
