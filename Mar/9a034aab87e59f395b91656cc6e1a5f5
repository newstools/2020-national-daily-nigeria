Barcelona’s squad is divided over a proposed pay cut from the club, according to Sport.
The Spanish club wants their high-earning players to make financial sacrifices, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact football and the world’s economy.
Barca are already struggling to meet their pre-season budget forecast, with all revenue streams reduced to almost zero.
Their first-team players’ salaries make up over 70% of the club’s wage bill and they are “split into three groups” over plans to slash their salaries.
The first set simply reject the proposed plan. They don’t see why they should sacrifice wages, when the club has made “economic investments in transfers that, they consider, do not make any sense or contribute anything to the club”.
A second group of players fully support the plan. This group has not given the go ahead just yet, but are said to be “willing” to agree to the proposition.
A third group are waiting for the decision from the Spanish Footballers’ Association.
