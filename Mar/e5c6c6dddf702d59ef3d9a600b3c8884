The Lagos State House Assembly has sealed the offices of the affected honourable members in the yesterday removal and suspension saga.

It would be recalled that at the plenary yesterday the Speaker Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa pronounced the suspension of the two honourable members, Hon. Moshood Oshun Lagos Mainland 2 and Hon. Adewale Raheem Ibeju Lekki 2,followed by the official removal of two principal officers, Hon. Rotimi Abiru Chief Whip and Hon. Olumuyiwa Jimoh Deputy Majority Leader.

The principal officers were not suspended but this morning their offices as well as that of the suspended members were sealed.

As reliably gathered, the seal up order had to be enforced so as to effect the agreed change influenced by a simple majority of the house,26 lawmakers signed a letter read on the floor of the house by the Clerk in compliance with rule 35 of the house.

In another development,the ongoing plenary today witnessed the immediate effect of the principal offices replacement,as Hon. Mojisola Miranda Apapa 1 replaces the deposed Hon. Rotimi Abiru Somolu 2 the former Chief Whip and Hon. Noheem Adams Eti-Osa1 replaced Hon. Muyiwa Jimoh as Deputy Majority Leader.
