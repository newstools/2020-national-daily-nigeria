The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) as sent AGF Abubakar Malami the list of former governors who have been receiving pension, and a re still getting paid as ministers or senators.
The revelation came as the rights group challenge President Muhammadu Buhari to enforce a court judgement the group received last year, ordering the federal government to deal with the issue.
Malami, in a letter, requested SERAP to furnish him with the list so as to take ation.
According to public records from which SERAP gleaned the details, there are 14 of double-dippers in the NASS. Others in Buhari’s cabinet (who are ex-governors) denied receiving double pay.
The following are reportedly collecting and/or have collected double emoluments and large severance benefits from their states: 
Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (Kano) 
Kabiru Gaya (Kano); 
Godswill Akpabio (Akwa Ibom) 
Theodore Orji (Abia) 
Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa) 
Sam Egwu (Ebonyi) 
Shaaba Lafiagi (Kwara)

Jonah Jang (Plateau). 
Ahmed Sani Yarima (Zamfara) 
Danjuma Goje (Gombe) 
Bukar Abba Ibrahim (Yobe)

“So far, Senator Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, Babatunde Fashola, Minister of Works and Housing, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, former Minister of Mines and Steel Development, and Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation have denied ever receiving double payments and retirement benefits as former governors,” SERAP’s Dep Director Kolawole Oluwadare stated in a release containing the names.
“Any further delay in the enforcement of the judgment will continue to undermine the authority and integrity of the Nigerian judiciary. Nigerians cannot wait for you to take legal action to scrap states’ pension laws and fully recover the public funds collected.”
