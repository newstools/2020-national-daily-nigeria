The status of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has become uncertain after he admitted having meeting with two victims who tested positive of coronavirus – the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State.  Accordingly, the Ekiti Governor directed all his 35 colleagues in the Nigerian Governor’s Forum to commence self-isolation immediately. Already Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has tested positive after hosting the son of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who is receiving treatment at the medical centre, Abuja, after testing positive of the virus.
Fayemi, Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, disclosed that he had done the coronavirus test having made contact with two persons who tested positive for COVID-19.
The Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, also tested positive on Tuesday and have been quarantined.
Kyari and the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, met with governors and ministers last week in their positive status.
In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Fayemi wrote, “I just took the Covid19 test having gone into self-isolation since yesterday evening. I’m asymptomatic and feel well but I was in meetings with two people who had since tested positive.
“I look forward to an all clear and I have encouraged all my colleagues to take the test.”
