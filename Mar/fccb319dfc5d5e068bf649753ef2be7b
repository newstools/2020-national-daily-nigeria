A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, and leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, have both questioned the whereabouts of both President Muhammadu Buhari and his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari after the latter tested positive to the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19.
However, apparently owing to Buhari’s refusal to physically address Nigerians as the coronavirus cases continue to worsen in the country, Fani-Kayode wrote on his Twitter handle-@realFFK:
“We need to be reassured that our President has not been whisked out of the country and that he has not been afflicted with Covid 19 or any other debilitating & life-threatening illness. We also need to be reassured that he is indeed Muhammadu Buhari and not Jubril Al Sudani.
“If he is too sick to continue he should resign & let someone else take over the reins of power but if he is well enough to continue he should get off his high horse, purge himself of his contempt for our people, come clean & behave like a responsible modern-day leader & not a feudal Arab Sheik or primitive tribal warlord.
In a similar development, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu insisted that Abba Kyari, who is suffering from the Covid-19 disease, had been flown out of Nigeria.
He claimed that, Kyari, President Muhammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, had been flown to Cuba to be treated of the deadly virus. But Kanu, who was silent on the rumour about Buhari, insisted that Kyari was not in Lagos but in Cuba for treatment.
 
The IPOB leader expressed worries that a former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu and former spokesman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olisah Metuh were languishing in jail, while Kyari, who he claimed had looted the budgetary allocation to the Aso Rock Clinic since 2015 was not in jail.
Kanu asked in a Facebook post, “Is Orji Uzor Kalu & Olisah Metuh in jail while the real Fulani criminals are allowed to scamper to Cuba for coronavirus treatment?
