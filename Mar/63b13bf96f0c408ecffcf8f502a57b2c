The Chairman of the League Management Company, Malam Shehu Dikko has assured that the body is closely working with the management of Nasarawa United to sort out the life insurance policy of late Martins Chineme.
Responding to public inquiries about the fate of the late player and the insurance plans of the LMC for players in the domestic scene, Dikko said, “We are already in conversation with our providers over his matter and the necessary paper works will commence once the autopsy report is out.”
He disclosed that the Nigeria Professional Football League organisers are already in possession of a copy of Chineme’s death certificate and will swing into action as soon as other necessary documents are obtained.
LMC and management of Nasarawa United have recently come under scathing attacks from Nigerians over the way the tragic incident was handled and managed on and off the pitch.
Dikko who doubles as the Nigeria Football Federation second Vice President appealed for patience and understanding from Nigerians while assuring that the LMC is determined to do the right thing.
“We sincerely appreciate football stakeholders concerns and respect their views on this sensitive matter. But, we must apply caution and thread softly so that we don’t jeopardise the whole process.”
Earlier today, the NFF President, Amaju Pinnick inaugurated the adhoc committee chaired by Dr Peter Singabele to investigate circumstances surrounding the death of Chineme and recommend robust solutions for standard protocols for football organization in Nigeria.
Chineme died on match day 23 against Katsina United in Lafia when he slumped unchallenged and subsequently died before he could receive proper medical attention.
