Juventus’ Coppa Italia semi-final second leg with AC Milan on Wednesday night has been postponed due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis in Italy.
The sides are level at 1-1 following the first leg, when Cristiano Ronaldo buried a controversial late penalty to cancel out Ante Rebic’s opener.
The virus has caused chaos with the Italian football calendar, with a number of Serie A fixtures postponed in recent weeks.
Juve’s top-of-the-table clash with Inter last weekend was one of five games postponed, having previously been earmarked to be played behind closed doors.
Udinese vs Fiorentina, Milan vs Genoa, Parma vs SPAL and Sassuolo vs Brescia were the four other fixtures postponed that weekend, and reorganised for May 13.
However, with more fixtures this week set to be called off, Juve’s game with Inter was reportedly set to be played on Monday, March 9 in order to ease potential fixture congestion later in the season.
Inter were reportedly unhappy with this resolution. President Steven Zhang called Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino “the biggest and darkest clown I have ever seen” over his handling of the fixture chaos.
A government decree has suspended all sporting events in regions affected by the coronavirus until March 8.
That has meant Juve’s game with Bologna will not go ahead. Atalanta vs Lazio, Inter vs Sassuolo, and Hellas Verona vs Napoli are the other games postponed this weekend
