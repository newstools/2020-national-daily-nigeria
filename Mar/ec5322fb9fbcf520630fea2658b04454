A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped antiviral treatment.
According to AFP, the so-called “London Patient”, a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, received cells from donors with a rare genetic mutation that prevents HIV from taking hold.
Billions of dollars have been committed to finding a cue for the deadly disease ravaging most of the third world.
