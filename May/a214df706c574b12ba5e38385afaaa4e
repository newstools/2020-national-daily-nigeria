Lagos State commenced phased easing of the coronavirus lockdown order on Monday with specific guidelines. The state government acknowledged that the battle to contain coronavirus is not yet over, but the movement restrictions had to be minimized to enable people resume activities for survival while the government continues finding solutions to the health crisis.
The Lagos State government warned against the abuse or breach of the phased easing of lockdown directives. The government, therefore, released telephone numbers for whistleblowers so people can call or report when they notice any evidence of flouting of social distancing or breach of other Covid-19 rules and regulations.
The numbers are:
09010513197
09010513198
09010513199

Though, the number of coronavirus infected persons has continue to increase, the state government has succeeded on isolation, treatment and discharge of coronavirus victims after a period of intervention.
