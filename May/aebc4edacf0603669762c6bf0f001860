The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) says churches and other worship centres may be reopened in the first week of June, and has therefore issued 13 guidelines as directed by the federal government.
In a statement signed by the President of CAN, Reverend Samson Ayokunle on Sunday, the Christian body said it is aware that COVID-19 is not over yet, but is in talk with the government on reopening of churches nationwide to assist in prayers.
“We hope that latest by the first week in June, we would be back in churches nationwide.
“The government from our discussions wants us to draw up suggested guidelines for worship in keeping with COVID-19 containment requirements and submit for approval.”
Reverend Ayokunle said CAN has drafted the guidelines, and will hopefully present the draft to government at a zoom meeting this week with the Secretary to the Government in company of the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar IV.
He listed the guidelines to include disinfectant of all Church premises, provide alcoholic sanitizers, temperature readers, soap and water in their premises to be supervised by medical professionals in the Church.
Also, every worshiper must wear face-mask, and social distancing should be observed in the sitting arrangement with one meter gap between two worshipers.
Rev. Ayokunle added that as part of the guidelines, churches can make use of classrooms and multipurpose halls for services where available, especially in big churches in order to accommodate more worshippers at a go.
Handshaking and hugging should be avoided before, during and after the service, among many others to contain the spread of the virus.
