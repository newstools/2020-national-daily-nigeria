The Lagos State Government invokes tougher measures in the efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state. The state government at the weekend sealed two social life facilities in Badagry West LCDA for defaulting on new guidelines to operators of hotels, clubs, and other entertainment outfits in the state by the government.
Lagos State government in a tweet via its official handle disclosed that the social facilities include Maggi Hotel, and Tambari Theatre Art (Night Club). The Special Adviser to the Governor on Tourism, Arts and Culture, Solomon Bonu, explained that despite the lockdown, the nightclub has continued to operate and promoting immoral activities.
The Special Adviser maintained: “It was also discovered that there is a high level of immorality going on in these places. The Night Club has become home for strippers, drug barons, and all sorts of mischief.”
He chided the management of the two facilities for promoting immoral activities and defying the coronavirus control measures. He insisted that the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture were not followed in spite of several advocacies by the state government.
The Special Adviser said legal action will be taken by the Lagos State government against the owners of the hotel and night club to ensure appropriate sanctions.
