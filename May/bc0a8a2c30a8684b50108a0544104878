While the PDP and its stalwarts prepare to give their take on President Muhammadu Buhari’s new CoS Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, the party’s VP candidate in the last presidential election has congratulated the new appointee in the APC government.
Peter Obi tweeted his congratulations shortly after Gambari’s appointment was announced by SGF Boss Mustapha on Wednesday.
“Congratulations Prof Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, CFR,” Obi tweeted.
“Your appointment as Chief of Staff to Buhari is indeed a good step in the right direction.”
Buhari has been criticized and accused of nepotism for appointing Gambari, 75, a Fulani from the Kwara , north-central, and of the holdovers of political and government office since 1983 when Buhari, then a general, toppled the Sheu Shagari government.
But Obi has a mind of his own, and it is sound enough to see how right the professor’s appointment is.
The former governor of Anambra has been supporting most of Buhari’s moves since Covid-19 pandemic hit Nigeria.
