Sokoto Gov Aminu Tambuwal has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to assist his state with logistics and technical support  in containing the spread of coronavirus.
He made the call during a statewide broadcast on COVID-19 on Monday.
According to him,  the state has so far recorded 66 cases of COVID-19 with eight deaths.
“Due to the rising statistics in Sokoto State, I wish to appeal to Mr President and the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 to intervene in our state, through the provision of logistics and technical support, with a view to stemming the disturbing trend,” he said.
The state reported its index case less than three weeks ago, and the fatalities have climbed up to 19, more than 50 percent of what Lagos, the epicentre of the pandemic reported since its first case in February.
Tambuwal is the first PDP governor to plead with Buhari for help.
