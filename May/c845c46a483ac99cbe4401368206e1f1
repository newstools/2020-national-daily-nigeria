The US President Donald Trump says it will be “redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs”.

He said in a recent press briefing that, “We are today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organizations”

Also, the President on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and vowed that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” He tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station.

The tweet was quickly flagged by Twitter as “glorifying violence.”

Earlier Thursday, Mr. Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.”

The president’s language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis Thursday night.

 “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!”

Twitter quickly tagged the post, saying, “This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.” It still is.

On Friday morning, the White House Twitter account retweeted it. Twitter added the same tag to that one, too.

The Trump tweet and reaction from Twitter came after the president signed an executive order Thursday taking aim at the legal shield that protects social media companies from liability for content posted by users on their platforms. That happened after a first-ever fact check by Twitter on his tweets this week.
