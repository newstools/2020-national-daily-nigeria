The Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has responded to the outcry of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 over shortage of bed spaces in hospitals dedicated to isolation centres for the treatment of coronavirus infection. The CBCN donated over 400 health facilities across the country for use as isolation centres for COVID-19.
The Catholic Bishops made the donated the facilities belonging to the Catholic Mission to strengthen the country’s health facilities in handling the coronavirus pandemic.
Several individuals and corporate bodies had earlier donated money to the tune N25 billion to the Nigerian government to strengthen the fight against the spread of coronavirus in the country. Some others donated medical facilities.
Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) had at the briefing of the Task Force last Friday declared: “We have received reports from the states, which suggests that the treatment centres are running out of bed spaces. As we assess the situation, the PTF shall also begin to examine our peculiar circumstances, modify the strategies for care management, and consider viable alternatives, where necessary. At the appropriate time, the guidelines and protocols shall be unfolded.”
Boss Mustapha had on Monday reiterated that the federal government is intensifying efforts to increase the number of treatment centres in the country as the figure of positive cases has continued to rise.
