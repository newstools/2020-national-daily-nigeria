Ogun Gov. Dapo Abiodun has found a way around President Muhammadu Buhari’s order easing the state’s lockdown.
Ogun, now, still remain under lockdown, according to the governor at a press briefing on Friday.
“For us in Ogun State, the extension will now end on Sunday, 9th May. That is, taking into consideration the initial one week of grace granted us by Mr. President,” he said.
The decision is informed by the rising cases of Covd-19 in the gateway state.
Abiodun said in the last few weeks, the number of confirmed cases in Ogun State has continued to rise to more than double.
He, however, cushion the sustained restriction.
“Our relaxation window remains Monday, 4th May; Wednesday, 6th May; and Friday, 8th May. The new time frame will, however, now be from 7am to 5pm on those days.”
He noted this will give the people time to conduct necessary economic activities and to get to their various homes before the commencement of the daily curfew as directed by Mr. President.
“For the avoidance of doubt, the curfew is from 8pm to 6am every day and will be strictly enforced,” he stated.
There are 56 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ogun State as against 35 confirmed cases a week ago.
Abiodun said that most of the new cases arise from the influx of immigrants, that is, Nigerians coming into the country through Ogun land borders and those coming into Ogun from other states of the country.
“On Tuesday 28th April, we discovered that 24 people entered Ilushin in Ogun Waterside LGA, and, just 24 hours after, another 12 people were rounded up in Odogbolu LGA. This calls for vigilance from all of us,” he said.
