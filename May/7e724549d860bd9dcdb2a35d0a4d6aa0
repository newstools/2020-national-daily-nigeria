Former international Ikechukwu Uche has opened up about his relationship with Stephen Keshi.
The forward was regular in the Super Eagles squad before the appointment of Keshi as the National Team head coach in 2011.
Uche lost his place in the starting line-up to Emmanuel Emenike at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals.
The 36-year-old player, who is currently a free-agent, made four appearances as the Super Eagles clinched the AFCON title.
Uche insisted that there were no problems between him and Keshi, who sadly died in June 2016 due to a heart attack.
“I went to him and asked if we had any problems and he said there was none. I always gave my all for Nigeria whenever I pulled on the Eagles shirt,”National Daily learnt from Brilla Fm during their chat with Uche.
Uche represented Nigeria at the 2008 and 2013 AFCON finals and the last time he played for the Super Eagles was in 2014.
The Aba-born player hit the back of the 19 times for four-time African champions and played 46 games for the West African giants.
He has played for Recreativo, Getafe, Zaragoza, Villarreal, Granada and Málaga in Spain.
