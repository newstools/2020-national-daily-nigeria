The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has assured of commitment to professional best practices in the war against corruption in Nigeria.
EFCC in a statement by the Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, acknowledged reports of a recent arrest of Ms Mnena Ato, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of  Star Shawarma, by officials of the commission in Makurdi,  Benue State.
Oyewale disclosed that the Commission has commenced investigations into the circumstances of her arrest and would leave no stone unturned in ensuring that all facts related to the arrest are unearthed.
“It is not in the character of the EFCC to act arbitrarily and the Commission is always guided by global best practices in its operations.
“The Commission wishes to assure members of the public of its commitment to best professional practices and excellent conduct of all its men and officers.
“As the Commission continues to pursue its mandate of ridding the nation of economic and financial crimes, appropriate sanctions would be placed on whoever is found to have acted out of character regarding the Benue arrest,” Oyewale declared in the statement.
