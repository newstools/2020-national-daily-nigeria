However, South Korea military noted that the shots were not likely to have been intentional.
US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, was said to have also acknowledged that the gunshots from North Korea were likely to be “accidental”.
No injuries were reported in the incident. Military officials in South Korea remarked that there was no sign of unusual troop movements.
