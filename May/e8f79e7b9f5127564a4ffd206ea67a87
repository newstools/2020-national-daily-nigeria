Premiership giant, Chelsea is eyeing Ajax left-back, Nicolas Tagliafico, in the next transfer window for a fee just north of £20million.
The Blues, who returned to training at their Cobham training base last week ahead of the proposed plan for the Premier League campaign to resume at some point in June, will be desperate to bolster their left-back options in the next window, with head coach Frank Lampard having sounded it out as one of the key areas he wishes to strengthen.
In recent months, the Stamford Bridge club have been heavily linked with moves for England international Ben Chilwell from Leicester City and Porto star Alex Telles.
But the Blues could focus all of their efforts on landing Argentinian international Tagliafico, who has cemented himself as one of the most consistently performing left-backs in European football over the last couple of years, as he played an integral role in helping the Ajax win the Eredivisie title last season, as well as helping them reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League.
However, the 27-year-old, according to his agent, is poised to leave the Johan Cruyff Arena once the next window officially opens for business, with his agent confirming that they are actively looking for a new club.
As quoted by the Daily Star, Ricardo Schlieper said: “We are looking for a transfer for Tagliafico.
It has since been reported by the Telegraph that the Blues would be able to secure the defender’s signature for £22.4million, which is set to be a far cheaper option that Chilwell, who is valued at around £40million.
Tagliafico, though solid in a defensive sense, would offer Lampard an alternative option when his side are on the attack, as he is renowned for bombing forward from the full-back position and playing a hand in the final third.
For instance, this season alone, Tagliafico has directly contributed to 12 goals, in terms of goals and direct assists, in the 38 matches he has played in.
