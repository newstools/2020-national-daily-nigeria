Lagos Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu is showing concerns for the state economy, and he is asking President Muhammadu Buhari to re-open key aspects of the economy, and they happen to be those that cater to the well-moneyed Lagosians only.
According to him, the aviation industry, as well as the entertainment, hospitality and transportation sectors, have been “significantly” affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Sanwo-Olu spoke as a panellist at a webinar hosted by FSDH Merchant Bank on Friday. The webinar, titled, ‘A global pandemic: local realities and peculiarities – a view from the frontlines’, was anchored by the Chairman, FSDH Holding Company, Mr Hakeem Belo-Osagie, and the bank’s Managing Director, Mrs Hamda Ambah.
“We all know that Nollywood employs many people, so we are thinking through how to reset these economies very quickly but in a very gradual manner,” he said.
“I spoke with a major player in that industry and we are trying to get the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to see whether we are going to resume Lagos–Abuja flights before we get to other sectors. There has to be some gradual process in lifting the lockdown.”
Lagos has been the epicentre of covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria, recording more than 50 percent of confirmed cases and deaths. 
This has made the federal government initially locked down the state, and three others, for five weeks before gradually relaxing the restriction, allowing businesses to open daily with a daily curfew from eight pm to 6 am.
Worship centres and inter-state travels remain on lockdown.
Many have questioned the soundness of this decision by the federal government. 
Now Gov. Sanwo-Olu seems to be thinking along that line too, even if for economic expediency.
