As a result of the increasing cases of coronavirus in the country, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, has told Nigerians to prepare for the worst as the federal government put in measures to contain the spread.
Ehanire stated this while speaking on Tuesday, during the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.
The Minister urged health workers and citizens to do their best to learn more about coronavirus, even as President Muhammadu Buhari extends the easing of restrictions in Lagos, Ogun and FCT.
“Yesterday, the President authorized extending easing of restrictions in Lagos, Ogun and FCT by another two weeks. The lockdown in Kano was also extended by two weeks, to address remaining challenges to containing the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
“It is of great importance that we – members of the health sector and citizens, endeavour to use this period to dedicate efforts to strive for the best, but also prepare for the worst.
“As we learn more about coronavirus every day, we must be ready to adjust our strategy, based on knowledge and evidence,” Ehanire said.
