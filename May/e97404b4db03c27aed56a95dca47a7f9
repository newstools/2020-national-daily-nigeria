One of the landed properties former Petrol Minister Allison Diezani Allison-Madueke forfeited in 2017 to the federal government has been converted to Isolation centre in Lagos.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Friday handed over the property to the Lagos government on Friday.
Lagos Zonal Head of the EFCC Mohammed Rabo stated during the handover that the gesture was part of the commission’s social responsibility efforts in containing covid-19 spread in Nigeria.
“In addition to our mandate to fight economic and financial crimes, the commission is committed and ready to render essential services that may be required of it in the fight against COVID-19.
“Therefore, Lagos State should not hesitate to call on the commission anytime the need for such an essential service arises.”
A statement by the EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, said Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, thanked the anti-graft agency for the gesture.
The governor also appreciate the attention the commission paid to the efforts of the state government at containing COVID 19.
He noted that “part of the challenges we have been facing is getting isolation centres for COVID-19 patients”.
