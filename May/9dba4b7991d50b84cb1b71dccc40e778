A top secret revealed by a resident of Wuhan, Mainland China, on the ravaging coronavirus has continued to generate skepticism across the world of China’s hidden mission on the COVID-19 pandemic. Essentially, certain hidden secrets are being revealed by inhabitants of Wuhan to the world.
An Executive Director at Ovex Technologies, Pakistan, Tahir Mahmood Chaudhry, in a tweet, exposed a “translation from an Indian living in Wuhan;” who revealed the secret of coronavirus treatment in China and the life span of the virus.
The secret was revealed that Chinese are not taking any medicine or vaccine to cure coronavirus. The Indian disclosed that every household has a coronavirus case. The disclosure was made that “they have stopped going to hospital for cure. They instead kill the virus with heat.” The resident disclosed that they take “Very hot steam inhalation from kettle four times a day; hot gargles four times a day; hot tea four times a day.” It was declared that the virus dies in four days, while on the fifth day, the carrier tests negative to coronavirus.
The revelation has, as the coronavirus tradition dictates, generated debates over validity or efficacy of the process by defenders of coronavirus orthodox belief. While some disqualified the entire process, a few acknowledged that taking of hot tea may be effective. But the revelation was made by a resident of Wuhan who had participated in the process, and also saw others do the sane thing and the result was confirmed.
