Worshippers in Dar Assalam mosque Neukolin, Germany, spilled over in their mosque because of social distancing rules on Ramadan morning, and a Marthan Lutheran church in Kreuzberg close by offered the Muslims its pew to observe their Islamic rites.
“It is a great sign and it brings joy in Ramadan and joy amid this crisis,” the mosque’s imam told Reuters news agency. “This pandemic has made us a community. Crises bring people get together.”
Samer Hamdoun, a mosque member said It was a strange feeling because of the musical instruments, the pictures, and other insignia in the church.
“But when you look, when you forget the small details. This is the house of God in the end.”
Even the Lutheran church’s pastor took part in the Ramadan.
“I gave a speech in German,” said Monika Matthias.
“And during prayer, I could only say yes, yes, yes, because we have the same concerns and we want to learn from you. And it is beautiful to feel that way about each other.”
Germany lifted restrictions on places of worship May 4, after weeks-long lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 diseases.
