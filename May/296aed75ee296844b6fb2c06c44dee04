The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, on Tuesday, raised red alert that some sanitizers being sold in Nigeria are sub-standard, indicating sale of fake sanitizers in the country. The minister at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVCID-19, in Abuja disclosed that study by a research institution in the Federal Ministry of Health discovered that not all sanitisers on sale in Nigeria are up to standard.
Ehanire revealed how people can identify standard sanitisers in the market, pointing out the importance of ascertaining the NAFDAC number and ingredients used in producing the sanitiser.
The Minister highlighted: “I will start by using the opportunity to issue an advisory on sanitiser. You will see a lot of sanitisers out in the market. A study carried out by research institution in the Ministry of Health has shown not all of them are up to standard.
“In buying sanitisers, there is an advisory I will like to share. You must look first of all at the NAFDAC number. A sanitiser should have a NAFDAC number.
“Secondly, it should have a place where the ingredients are displayed. You must see that it contains a minimum of 60% alcohol. If it is anything different from that, the sanitiser is not going to do the job you think it is doing.”
