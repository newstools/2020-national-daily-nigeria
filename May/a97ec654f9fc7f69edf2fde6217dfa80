Contrary to claims by the military authorities that Boko Haram insurgents have recently been decimated to weakening point that the leader is ready to surrender, the terrorists on Wednesday invaded Debiro community in Biu Local Government Area, Borno State.
The Boko Haram invaders were armed to the teeth with sophisticated weapons, violently entered the community in five Toyota Hilluxes, shooting sporadically to register their presence which subsequently frightened the residents, causing the locals to flee into surrounding bushes.
The local vigilante could not match the fireworks or exchange of gunfire of the Boko Haram invaders. The attempt by the vigilante to resist the terrorists was overwhelmed by the fireworks of the terrorists and could not fight back positively. The local vigilante were compelled to retreat to and surrender to the superior fire power of the Boko Haram terrorists.
It was disclosed that the last time Debiro which is 48 kilometers to the local government headquarters was attacked was 2018.
There was no resistance from neither the Police or Army to the Boko Haram invaders, which made them have field day in carrying out their mission.
It was highlighted that the terrorists burnt primary school and other public buildings in the community.
