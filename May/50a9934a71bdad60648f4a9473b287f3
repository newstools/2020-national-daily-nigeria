The world recorded over 100,000 new cases of covid-19 over the last 24 hours.
The World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said during a press 0conference at the agency’s headquarters, Geneva.
“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” he said.
The majority of the newly confirmed cases are coming from the Americas, followed by Europe. On Tuesday alone, the U.S. and Russia reported 45,251 and 9,263 new cases on Tuesday, respectively.
No fewer than five million cases have been confirmed around the world as 325,000 fatalities have also been recorded in about five months.
Cases seem to be spiking as most of the countries on lockdown before are lifting restrictions, thereby stimulating community transmission.
