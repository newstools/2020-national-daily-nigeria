The Arewa United Political Forum (AUPF), led by Alhaji Mohammed Dandama has described the Sarkin Hausawa of Lagos as “superstar of the Arewa Community in Lagos.”

In a media statement, Dandama said the Sarkin Hausawa, who doubles as the Arewa Council of Chief’s Chairman in Lagos State has “given out huge amount of cash to members of the Arewa community, who were on the verge of losing hope completely in the authorities”.

Dandama who doubles as the head of Shukarah Yam Depot in Mile Twelve market, explained that it would be difficult to identify any northern leader in Lagos who made such an unexpected gesture to those in difficulty”.

The group said the monarch is worthy of celebration for doing what many have failed to do despite their huge cash and material resources.

They called on the wealthy class in the society to copy from the “beautiful heart and empathy  displayed by the Sarkin Hausawa” adding that it would be helpful in giving the  followers of any leader a sense of appreciation and of belonging.

The group also said the Lagos State Government needs to set up an independent audit to ascertain the whereabout of the tons of rice it was reported to have set aside for the Arewa community in Lagos, saying the Governor needs to set example in auditing.
