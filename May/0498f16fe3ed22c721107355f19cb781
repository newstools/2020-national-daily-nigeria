The presidency has responded to media stories that Madagascar billed Nigeria 170,000 euros for the consignment of Covid-Organics delivered to Aso Rock on Sunday.
But President Muhammadu Buhari’s personal assistant on social media, Lauretta Onochie, is insisting Nigeria got no bill from Madagascar.
According to the initial reports, the AU directed the supply of the drugs to African countries and Nigeria was asked to pay over €170,000 (N78, 200,000).
However, Onochie said the organic tonic was a gift.
“Federal Government did not receive any bill from Madagascar,” she tweeted.
“We insist that the COVID-ORGANIC CVO from Madagascar, was a brotherly gift from one nation to some African countries.”
