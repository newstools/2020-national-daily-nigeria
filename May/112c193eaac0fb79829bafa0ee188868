Yobe State government has refuted that the strange deaths recorded in the state recently are not caused by coronavirus pandemic. Strange deaths have caused fears to residents of Potiskum, Nguru and Gashua since the beginning of May. The occurrence of strange death has been spread across some states in northern Nigeria from Kano to Yobe, Jigawa and Sokoto states.  People die in numbers daily in those states, killed by unknown ailment.
Records show that from May 1 to May 8, many people who died of strange ailment were deposited in graveyards daily in Potiskum, Nguru and Gashua, Yobe State.
The cause of the mystery deaths is yet unknown. There were, however, attempts to link the strange deaths to coronavirus which the Yobe State government disputed.
It was disclosed that at the Mamman Ali graveyard in Potiskum, over 12 corpses were being buried daily.
The Commissioner for Health in Yobe State was said to have admitted the frequency of strange deaths recently in the state but maintained that they are not caused by coronavirus.
A senator at the weekend said that hunger is what is killing people in Jigawa State not coronavirus.
