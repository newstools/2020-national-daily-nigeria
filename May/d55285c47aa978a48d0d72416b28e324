The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday refuted claims that the test kits in Tanzania are faulty. The Centre declared that the coronavirus test kits in Tanzania are reliable.
Tanzanian President, John Magufuli, had on Monday restricted the national laboratory from further coronavirus tests, protesting that he secretly tested some animals and fruits, and a goat, a quail and pawpaw tested positive to coronavirus. The president expressed the fear that the test kits are already contaminated and increase the risk of escalating coronavirus infection in the country.
The Africa Centre for Disease Control, however, upheld the validity of the test kits. The Director of the Africa CDC, John Nkengasong, declared: “The tests that Tanzania and all African countries are using are tests that we have validated and we know that they are performing very well.
“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries and providing them with test kits.
“We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”
President Magufuli noted that Tanzania only updated coronavirus data on April 29, when 480 cases were recorded.
 
President Magufuli told Tanzanian citizens to continue attending Church and Mosque. The President further disclosed that he is negotiating with the President of Madagascar for a herbal tea the country discovered for cure of coronavirus.
The Covid-Organics discovered in Madagascar is a drink derived from artemisia, a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment, and other indigenous herbs.
Many African countries have been contacting the President of Madagascar for the Organics.
