President of Madagascar, Andy Rajoelina, has revealed the reasons why the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other western countries are against his country’s new drug for COVID-19, “COVID Organics”
Rajoelina, while appearing on France 24 News, said that the only reason the rest of the world had refused to take the herbal cure seriously and with respect was that it came from Africa.
“I think the problem is that (the drink) comes from Africa and they can’t admit… that a country like Madagascar… has come up with this formula to save the world. If it wasn’t Madagascar, and if it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt? I don’t think so,” Rajoelina said.
“What is the problem with Covid-Organics, really? He asked. Wondering if it could be that this product comes from Africa,” he added.
President Rajoelina who also alleged that the World Health organisation, WHO, offered his country the sum of $20m as bribe to poison COVID-19 cure,  insisted that the herbal remedy called ‘COVID Organics’ made from Artemisia can cure COVID-19 patients within ten days.
The President also wondered if it was not alright for a country like Madagascar, which is the 63rd poorest country in the world, to have come up with something that can help save the world.
He noted that if it was not Madagascar, but a European country that had actually discovered the Covid organic, there would not be so much doubt.
