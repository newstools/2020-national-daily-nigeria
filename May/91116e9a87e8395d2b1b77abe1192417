The Anambra State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), says herdsmen and Boko Haram killings are more dangerous than the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic.
The state chairman of CAN, Rev Ndubuisi John stated this in a statement he issued in Onitsha, claiming that since the emergence of COVID-19 till date, Nigeria has recorded more deaths from herdsmen and insurgents than from the virus.
Ndubuisi said: “For instance, last month in Yobe State, Nigeria lost 100 gallant combatant soldiers to Boko Haram insurgents who ambushed and battered their lives with bullets.
“Oh! what a loss to Nigerian government two weeks ago in Plateau State where herdsmen bombarded the Miango community, killing as many people as they could since they have the monopoly of guns.
“Few weeks ago at Askira Uba, a community in Borno state, the insurgents invaded and shattered the unarmed community with bullets sending many of them to their early graves.
“And also in Taraba State, herdsmen killed 25 persons. My question therefore is: where are the true elders of this great nation?
“Do you not know that some states are gradually dying out in this country? Many governors have cried out to the Federal Government, seeking for security aid. How much blood do we want to spill?”
