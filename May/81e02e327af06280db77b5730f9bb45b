Barcelona legend Xavi has warned the club not to sign Sadio Mane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as he believes that both players will flop at Camp Nou.

Xavi admits that Mane and Aubameyang are great players with good qualities, but he has advised Barcelona not to sign them. He believes that both players will struggle to adapt to the style used by Quique Setien’s side.

He said : ‘Mane and Aubemayang can kill you in open space. But Barcelona need players who know how to move in small spaces.

‘I am thinking about player who would adapt to Barcelona and it’s not easy to find one. Samuel Eto’o was perfect as is Luis Suarez right now.’
