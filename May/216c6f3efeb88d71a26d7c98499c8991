President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday took delivery of COVID-19 Organics, herbal remedy for coronavirus, from Madagascar.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a series of tweets on Saturday, acknowledging the delivery of the Organics, explained that samples of the herbal remedy were brought by the President of Guinea Bissau, Umaro Embalo.
President Buhari was said to have insisted that all necessary procedures will be put in place before allowing traditional or any new medicines to be administered on Nigerians.
“We have our institutions, systems and processes in the country. Any such formulations should be sent to them for verification. I will not put it to use without the endorsement of our institutions,” Buhari had said, according to the statement.
