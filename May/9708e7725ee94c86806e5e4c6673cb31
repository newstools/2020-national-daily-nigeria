The much-projected cabal in the Nigerian seat of power, State House, Abuja, may have become engulfed in catatonic trepidation as the new Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, commences the resetting of the presidency towards reorganizing the Buhari administration. National Daily had earlier reported of panic in the presidency after the appointment of Gambari who was acknowledged in the report as coming to cleanup the presidency. The earlier report indicated that with the coming of Gambari, which was conceived to have displaced the cabal in presidency, certain principal officers in the presidency, including some ministers, heads of MDAs, may be thrown out in the new dispensation.
There are emerging indications that the cleansing may be underway in the seat of power. Actions are being taken to evaluate the activities of the office of the Chief of Staff to the Presidency under the reign of late Abba Kyari. The inquiry has the tendency to relieve some political appointees of their jobs, as earlier reported by National Daily.
Meanwhile, detailed findings from the inquiry in the presidency could determine those to retain and those to be relieved.
The signals from the presidency shows that those who benefited from the old order under the regime of Abba Kyari have reasons to panic as the inquiry progresses. The fallout may not be limited to the State House but may extend to other sectors of the executive.
Beside appointments, the inquiry may extend to financial administration of the presidency in the past five years before the death of Abba Kyari.
However, presidency sources revealed that the inquiry in the seat of power may not be for witch-hunting, noting that since there was no handover note or brief to the new Chief of Staff, the CoS would want to ascertain where he is starting from to enable him keep proper record of the administration of the presidency under his watch.
The events are being monitored as they unfold.
