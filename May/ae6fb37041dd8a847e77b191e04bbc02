The chairman of the Lagos chapter of the Nigeria Union of Road Transport Worker (NURTW) has broached an idea of digitizing the three-wheeler transport system in Lagos, and he just divided Lagosians.
In an Instagram interview with Funmi Iyanda on Public Eye, Musliliu Akinsanya aka MC Oluomo said the state is digitizing commercial participation of motorcycles and Napep in state transport system that is always in chaos.
While many Nigerians who have seen the interview got somewhat blown away by the depth of Oluomo’s understanding of the transport system, others believed there was nothing new in all he said. After all, Go Kada, O-ride, and other e-hailing start-ups were doing great before the state government put them out of business.
What got a lot more chin-wags was the language—Yoruba—Olumo spoke.
Iyanda excused this, though.
“Apologies to non-Yoruba speakers as the NURTW interview is mostly in Yoruba,” she said.
“One day, a new generation will be given the sciences, tech and humanities education in their mother tongue whilst learning other regional languages and English as additional language….”
Oluomo has been featuring in public discourses now, and many think not much will come from the leader of a union that has the reputation for menacing society.
He guested in during workshop the University of Lagos, Akoka, organized earlier on, and he spoke also on managing the state transport system.
