Ifeanyi Ubah has finally scaled through at the Supreme Court as duly elected Senator of the Nigerian National Assembly, representing Anambra South in the federal legislature.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the appeals by Chris Uba and Obinna Uzor of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The five-member panel of justices of the Supreme Curet led by Justice Sylvester Ngwuta in its judgment held that the FCT High Court lacked the territorial jurisdiction to determine a matter that arose from the primary election conducted in Anambra State. It further upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal which restored the election of Ubah in the 2019 general elections.
