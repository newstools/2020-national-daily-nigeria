A lawmaker has been killed by coronavirus in Nasarawa State. The state Governor, Abdullahi Sule, at a media briefing on Sunday in Lafia,  announced the death of Adamu Suleiman, a member of Nasarawa State  House of Assembly, noting that the legislator died before the result of his test came out positive of coronavirus.
Hon. Suleiman is the first coronavirus death recorded Nasarawa State since Nasarawa reported its index case of the virus. Suleiman was representing Nasarawa Central Constituency at the State House of Assembly.
Governor Sule at the briefing highlighted: “There is also one member of the House of Assembly who was admitted in Keffi and started showing signs and after we took his samples, unfortunately, before the results came out, he died and he was buried according to Muslim rites.
“However, yesterday by the time his result came out, it turned out to be positive. So, that really complicated our situation because the member had been part of all recent sittings of the members of the house of Assembly.”
The governor added that after the COVID-19 status of the lawmaker was detected, members of his family and those living in the house were taken into isolation. Governor Sule said that their samples have been collected for testing by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
Governor Sule stated: “Because of his (Suleiman’s) association and contact, we have decided to close down the House of Assembly until we trace all his contacts.
“I am happy to state that all the members of the House of Assembly have agreed to be isolated and samples of some of them have been collected which is to be taken to the NCDC today.
“We are also isolating the family of the late member and those who attended the burial, especially, those who gave him the usual ritual bath.
“Once more, I want to appeal to the people of Nasarawa for their cooperation during this period.”
