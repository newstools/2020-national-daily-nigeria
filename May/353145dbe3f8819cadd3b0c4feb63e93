His Royal Highness, Alhaji Mohammed Asha, Emir of Kaura-Namoda, Zamfara State, has been declared dead. The royal father was perceived to have been killed by coronavirus complications while receiving treatment at an Isolation centre in Gusau.
The Commissioner for Health in Zamfara State, Yahaya Kanoma, was said to have disclosed that the late Emir became sick on Friday and was taken to the Specialist Hospital, Gusau, where the royal father was said to have shown symptoms of COVID-19 in conjunction with his wife. He was, therefore, taken into isolation and his blood sample collected for testing.
The Commissioner lamented that the Emir died in the early hours of Sunday while the result of his sample was being awaited.
Kanoma expressed reservations, however, that it will be too early to conclude that the late royal father died of COVID-19 until his test result is out.
The late Emir have been buried in accordance with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocol and guidelines on the burial of COVID-19 victims.
It was gathered that all the family members and close associates of the deceased have been quarantined; the hospital he was admitted and other places he visited have been decontaminated.
