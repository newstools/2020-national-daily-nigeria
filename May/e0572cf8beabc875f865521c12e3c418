Cambodia, a Southeast Asian country, on Saturday recorded zero coronavirus case after the country discharged the last COVID-19 patient. However, the country sustains the lockdown measures for vigilance against resurgence.
The Cambodian Health Minister was cited to have stated that the last coronavirus patient, a 36-year-old woman from northwest Banteay Meanchey province, was discharged on Saturday from the Khmer Soviet Friendship Hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh.
Cambodia with a population of 16 million, has declared zero coronavirus cases but remains vigilant.
The Cambodian government still insists on sustaining the restrictions, appealing to citizens to remain vigilant. The government insists on closure of schools and border entry points, including quarantine measures.
Record shows that Cambodia had 122 positive coronavirus cases, cured all without single death record.
The Health Minister, Mam Bunheng, was cited to have declared on Saturday: “We think that most of the cases, generally, are imported, so we must be careful with all checkpoints at the border, at airports, at ports, at land checkpoints.
“People who travel from abroad must have a certificate confirming that they don’t have COVID-19. Only then would we allow them in, and once they are in, they will be quarantined for another 14 days.”
