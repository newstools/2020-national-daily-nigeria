The leader of Idi-Araba Resident Youth Association in Lagos, Munzali Hamisu Maiyafe has expressed the appreciation of the youth to the recent cash donation for Arewa Community in the State, by the Sarkin Hausawa and Chairman Arewa Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Aminu Yaro Dogara.

Meyafe, in a terse press release said the Sarkin Hausawa has done “something quite spectacular in the lives of our people here in Idi-Araba and we will remain ever grateful”.


“The relief is apt in that it is coming at a time we started feeling abandoned, the Sarki has  completely changed our mindset. We’re now very hopeful that we have a caring leader, ready to make all sacrifice for our common good”.

The Sarkin Hausawa has become the subject of appreciation, especially among the Arewa community for what many saw as his surprise gift for people considered of going through a form of frustration arising from alleged abandonment by the authorities.
Reports show that monarch’s public rating has risen, especially in the Arewa community of the State.
