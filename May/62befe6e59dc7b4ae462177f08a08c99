It was declared that at the end of the meeting on Thursday, the Commission made the following resolutions:
To carry out comprehensive decontamination of its National Headquarters, annex at Blantyre Street, the Electoral Institute and its Area 10 Office housing its staff clinic.
To follow the federal government guidelines on resumption protocols and procedure by providing infrared thermometers, soap and water at entrances and installing hand sanitizer dispensers at strategic points in the Commission.
To train its staff, particularly, the cleaners and office assistants on cleaning protocols and strict compliance with federal government guidelines as well as its own specific protocol for resumption.
These preparatory resumption measures will set the stage for arrangements to conduct the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states.
However, the Commission was silent on the issue of crowd control as contained in the federal government protocol in the efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria. Though, the governorship elections are to hold later in the year, electioneering signals at this stage of fight against coronavirus may stimulate breaches of control protocols during either political meetings or mini rallies, even the support mobilization process.
However, INEC could resolve all these during consultation with political parties and other stakeholders.
