A 26-year-old man making a video call to his girlfriend on a highway at Adedero, around Sagamu-Abeokuta road, Ogun, was hit by a moving vehicle May 6.
Olajide Asade had been waiting in the bus he took from Kuto, Abeokuta, while the driver went about refueling the vehicle.
In the meantime, Asade,according to his younger brother travelling with him, crossed to the other side of the road to continue the video call he started from Kuto.
According to road traffic officers who confirmed the incident, there are lots of road diversion and construction going on around the area.
Still on the video call, Asade was crossing back to the other side where his bus was waiting when he bumped into a Honda Odyssey car carrying empty crates of eggs.
The car driver, Asade’s brother said, was on normal speed.
Traffic officers confirmed this too.
“The man, while crossing back to the other side of the road, was making a video call and was oblivious to the fact that a vehicle was coming from the Sagamu end to Abeokuta,” a road traffic officer said.
“The vehicle, a Honda Odyssey, hit him and he died on the spot.
“His corpse has been deposited in the morgue of the General Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta, while the driver of the Honda Odyssey and the vehicle are now at the state Motor Traffic Division, Ibara, Abeokuta.”
