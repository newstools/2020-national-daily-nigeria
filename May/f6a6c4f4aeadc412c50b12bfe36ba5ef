The resumption of the German Bundesliga last week has set the tempo for the long awaited return of European club football.
The return of Serie A is imminent as clubs have ordered their players back to training.
Serie A clubs returned to training on May 4 but are restricted to training in small groups and must respect social distancing guidelines.
Cristiano Ronaldo who spent most of the lockdown period in his native Madeira is back in Italy to resume training.
Meanwhile, the former United talisman who amazed fans with a bearded new look during lockdown was seen spotting yet another new look after Georgina Rodriguez gave him braids for his return to Juventus.
The Portuguese captain was seen arriving for training on Tuesday sporting a new hairstyle courtesy of his girlfriend.

Sharing a picture on Instagram, Rodriguez wrote: “I love to pamper my loves. This afternoon I practice with braids (this model knows how to stay still)”.
Ronaldo will go ahead to share a picture of himself and his new look, giving two thumbs up at Juventus’ training ground.
Expectedly, the former Real Madrid goal poacher who returned to Turin in a private jet earlier this month was forced to stay away from training to observe a 14-day quarantine having only just arrived back in the country.

The Old Ladies had already begun training again at the club’s Continassa facility in Turin from last week, but were restricted to just individual workouts.
Interestingly, Tuesday was the first day that all players were able to train again in small groups, with Ronaldo making an appearance to undergo medical tests.
