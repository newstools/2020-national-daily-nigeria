The Arewa Good Governance Frontier (AGGF) has expressed displeasure over the Lagos State Government alleged “selective patronage” in the distribution of palliatives, going by its seeming neglect of the Arewa community in Lagos.
In a statement made available to newsmen by the Chairman of the AGGF,Comrade Abdullahi Mu’azu lamented the imbalance in the manner the state government is relating with the Hausa community.
“We are not comfortable with the situation where the LASG is found wanting in the area of a sense of fairness and balance amongst residents of the State”.
The group also expressed disappointment over media reports on the untoward conduct of the Lagos State Commissioner of Waterfront, who was said to have received tons of rice in the name of arewa community and since then, nothing has been heard of it.
“The said commissioner must come clean on what really happened to the tons of rice meant for a people who have never seen it yet.
“We call on the Arewa Community in Lagos to take all legitimate steps in claiming what was due to them, in the spirit of Justice for all”.
