Rivers Gov. Nyesom Wike was right there marshalling the destruction of two hotels that violated the state’s Covid-19 lockdown regulations on Sunday at 11 am.
His action was no surprise, though. He warned the owners of the flea bags the state’s bulldozer was coming.

Prudent Hotel at Alode in Eleme Local Government Area and Etemeteh Hotel, Onne got marked for demolition because they refused to shut down following the lockdown of the two local government areas, according to Paulinius Nsirim, commissioner for communications.
Rivers has recorded 4 new cases on Friday, and the total stands at 24.
