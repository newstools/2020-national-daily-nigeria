The World Health Organization (WHO) has suspended the chloroquine trial in progress as a cure for the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has temporarily suspended testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as a precautionary measure, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news conference on Monday.

Meanwhile, Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergency program, warned in the same virtual news conference that, despite countries easing lockdowns, the world is “right in the middle of the first wave” of the outbreak, and there could be a second peak within the wave.
