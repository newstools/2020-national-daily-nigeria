Few weeks former CoS Abba Kyari died from Covid-19 complications, the presidency has moved to ruffle the backrooms, and fear has gripped those, especially the MDAs, who might have done anything shady with the late CoS.
According to information filtering out, President Muhammadu Buhari has given the go-ahead for this. No reason was given, though, according to the Guardian.
But a raft of controversial deals cut and sealed while Kyari was in office might be dusted up again.
Among them was the MTN multi-billion-dollar fine settlement which roped in Kyari-that he collected N500 million. It was a claim no media which reported it could verify then.
Other cases included those raised while the CoS and the NSA Babagana Monguno washed their dirty laundry in the open early in the year.
Two memos from the office of the NSA where Monguno exploded, accusing Kyari of commandeering the service chiefs (as the commander-in-chief) in the battle against Boko Haram.
In the second memo, the NSA also accused Kyari of cutting an underhand deal with a military hardware company in the UAE to supply the Nigerian police.
President Buhari never queried his CoS then, and he even defended him occasion, which is why it is still a speculation the president could make any effort to shame his right-hand man in death.
In his tribute, Buhari said the late Kyari served him loyally for about three decades.
Perhaps those Kyari gored while he was being loyal to Buhari are the ones trying to rake up the muck in the CoS office.
