The public health authorities has extended the months-long lockdown initially imposed on citizens by three months because of poor compliance with disease-control measures the Centre for Disease Control initially put out.
Los Angeles County’s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer stated this during a board meeting Tuesday.
“We are being guided by science and data that will safely move us forward along the road to recovery in a measured way—one that allows us to ensure that effective distancing and infection control measures are in place,” Ferrer said.
The LA Times reported Ferrer the county is counting on the public’s compliance with the orders to be able to relax restrictions.
Los Angeles County is now the California epicenter of the coronavirus, with more than 1,300 deaths so far.
The US has ratcheted up cases to 1.3 m, and deaths have climbed towards 90,000, the world’s highest so far.
Nigeria, on the other hand, will be reviewing its measures imposed May 4 in the effort to ease the lock down.
The Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 has also lamented how poor compliance with the NCDC guideline is rampant, and why it is likely Nigeria might also go under lockdown as cases increase.
Currently, Nigeria has recorded 157 deaths, and close 4787 infections.
