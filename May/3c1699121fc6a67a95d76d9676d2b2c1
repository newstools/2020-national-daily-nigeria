While Covid-19 scourge bites citizens harder across the county, state governors have started opening up life as the citizens knew it before the pandemic hit Nigeria Feb 27.
Churches and mosques apparently got the first mention in this direction.
And, again, total easing of the weeks-long lockdown across the nation is being championed by governors of some states in the north while their southern counterpart are contemplating another stretch of lockdown.
Borno Gov. Zulu was reported much earlier on Thursday to have lifted the ban he initially placed on religious gathering.
Zulus decision was followed by that of Gombe Gov. Inuwa Yaya. 
Adamawa too was on the list.
But down south, Lagos Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu is proposing to the citizens a choice for an extension of the state lockdown.
Ogun has also been extending its lockdown too while Osun, Ekiti Ondo, and Oyo have kept the ban on religious gathering by using the NCDC guidelines which ban any gathering more than 20 people
Many Nigerinas have indicated their desire for further easing of the NCDC guidelines. 
The Gombe State Government, on Thursday, lifted the ban placed on religious activities.
