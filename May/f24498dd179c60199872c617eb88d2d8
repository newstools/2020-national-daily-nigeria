Nigerian has begun mobilization of support for Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, who is being accused of certain irregularities.
The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, in a letter, requested Chairman of the AfDB Board of Governors, Kaba Niale, to follow established processes to protect and preserve the heritage of continent’s bank. The Nigerian Finance Minister argued that the call for an independent investigation of the AfDB President is outside of the laid down rules, procedures and governing system of the bank and its articles as it relates to the code of conduct on ethics for the President. She urged the board to shun demands for an independent investigation of Adesina.
A group of whistleblowers, had in a petition accused Adesina of 20 breaches of the bank’s code of conduct, which they said include “unethical conduct, private gain, an impediment to efficiency, preferential treatment, and involvement in political activities.”
Hajia Zainab Ahmed, however, declared:  “The call for an independent investigation of the president is outside of the laid down rules, procedures and governing system of the bank and its articles as it relates to the code of conduct on ethics for the president.”
Dr. Adesina had in response to the allegations said that he is innocent of all allegations of fraud leveled against him. He also expressed his belief that a just, transparent and fair process would prove his innocence.
