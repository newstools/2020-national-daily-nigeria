The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has denied issuing any Post-COVID-19 travel guidelines for air travelers in the country.
General Manager, Corporate Affairs, FAAN, Henrietta Yakubu, who signed the agency’s statement issued at the weekend, said the attention of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has been drawn to a press release by a certain Tayo on Saturday to the effect that the Federal Government of Nigeria, through FAAN has released a post-covid-19 travel guideline for air travelers”.
“We want to state emphatically that although FAAN is carefully and seriously working on a guideline, the release did not emanate from us as it is still a work in progress. Consequently, the Authority will like to enjoin air travellers and the general public to disregard the content of the said medium.”
Yakubu pointed out that FAAN, at the appropriate time, would release the post-COVID-19 guidelines through its official communication medium.
It would be recalled that on May 6, 2020, the Federal Government extended the suspension of flight operations (both local and international) by another 4 weeks, as part of measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The extension occurred a few days before President Buhari announced the gradual easing of lockdown in Lagos state, Ogun state and Abuja.
The airline industry has been one of the hardest-hit sectors by the coronavirus disease outbreak. It has led to a lot of job losses and salary reductions.
