President Muhammadu Buhari commends President of the African Development Bank, Nigeria’s Dr Akinwumi Adesina, over the clean bill of health given him by Board of Directors of the financial institution.
It would be recalled that the Chairman of the Bureau of AfDB Board of Governors, Niale Kaba, had in a report on May 5, 2020 indicated that Dr. Adesina had been exonerated of allegations against him by whistleblowers, which were thoroughly investigated by the Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors, and a recommendation made to Governors of the African Development Bank, and African Development Fund.
According to Kaba, in the report, “On the basis of the results contained in the report of the committee, I am of the view that we should adopt its conclusions by declaring that the President is totally exonerated of all the allegations made against him.”
Reacting to the outcome of the investigation, President Buhari in statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, described Adesina as a thorough technocrat who has served the African continent well, and has made his motherland proud.
And subsequently wished him greater successes in the position of responsibility he occupies.
