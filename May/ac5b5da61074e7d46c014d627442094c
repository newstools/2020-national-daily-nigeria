Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has been most decisive in containing the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria.
He has his reason: he infected four persons as the first case in the state.
“I was the first case, fortunately, I would say, because it served to scare everyone about reality. COVID is real; it’s not a joke. I was the first case, I got it in Abuja and infected four other people, all of us are okay now,” said El-Rufai.
He made this known while giving an update on measures put in place to curb the spread of the disease in the state said he got infected in Abuja.
He added that Kaduna State has successfully reduced traffic into the State.
The state has a total of 35 confirmed cases of the disease
