Delta State  government has refuted reports that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has been appointed to lead National Economic Council (NEC) sub-committee on post-COVID-19 economic growth.
The state government in a statement in Asaba on Monday remarked that the report which had been circulating in the mainstream and social media, and had attracted a myriad of inquiries and goodwill messages was untrue.
The government  explained that NEC, headed by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, recently created a Sub-Committee chaired by Okowa, to liaise with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on the modalities for lifting the national lockdown and re-opening the economy.
it was pointed out that setting up of sub-committees to deal with pressing national issues such as COVID-19, was a routine of NEC, and therefore, not something deserving of media frenzy.
The state government noted that Governor Okowa was mindful of the earnest desire of Nigerians for life to return to normal as quickly as possible, but that it had become necessary to set the record straight and correct the wrong impression the reports had created about the “appointment’’.
“The media and the public are please requested to take note of this clarification and take appropriate steps to stop the misinformation.
“The governor urges Nigerians to continue to pray for divine intervention to resolve the current health crisis, while also maintaining the necessary safety protocols and guidelines,’’ the statement read in part.
