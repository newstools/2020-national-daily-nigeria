Leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have broken the lockdown rules proclaimed by President Muhammadu Buhari when they converged in Abuja, having moved from Edo State, to pick Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu as consensus candidate of the party for the September governorship election. How did the party leaders from Edo State get into Abuja at a time the President imposed restrictions on inter-state travels in the efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country.
The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, who mis Secretary to the Government of the Federation, has consistently at the daily briefing in Abuja complained of  breaches and non-cooperation in enforcing the restrictions on inter-state travels. Invariably, APC politicians who converged in Abuja from Edo State to pick Ize-Iyamu as governorship candidate for the Edo election may have to account for their movement.

Meanwhile, the Adams Oshiomhole APC faction in Edo State endorsed Ize-Iyamu on Tuesday for the state’s governorship election.
The faction declared Ize-Iyamu APC candidate in Abuja after a meeting with a committee appointed by Adams Oshiomhole to screen about eight governorship aspirants.
Meanwhile, Oshiomhole faction will be sponsoring Ize-Iyamu to challenge Governor Godwin Obaseki at the party primaries which date or procedures are yet to be made public by the APC national leadership.
Former APC national chairman, Chief John Oyegun, had last week said that President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered that the Edo and Ondo states governors who are serving out their first terms should be given a chance of the first refusal for a second germ ticket of the party for the governorship elections in their states. Oshiomhole appears to be disregarding President Buhari and sponsoring Ize-Iyamu against Governor Obaseki in defiance of the president’s statement.
