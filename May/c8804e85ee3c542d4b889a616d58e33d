The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has cautioned Nigerians to be wary of fraudsters using the Coronavirus pandemic to defraud unsuspecting victims.
The EFCC chairman said that fraudsters are on the prowl, promising innocent Nigerians access to palliatives from the government, in a bid to manipulate their banking details against them.
“Do not accept calls from unknown person purporting to be in charge of distribution of palliatives on behalf of federal government or asking you to send details of your bank account,” Magu said.
