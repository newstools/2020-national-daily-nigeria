President Muhammadu Buhari has shut his door against government officials, contractors, traditional rulers, and others intending to pay him Eid-el-Fitr homages at the State house, Abuja. The president notified those officials, political and religious leaders intending to visit the Villa that his doors will not be open because of the coronavirus prevention protocols.
The president, in a statement on Friday, reiterated that he restricted visitations in compliance with the safety measures of the Federal Capital Territory to contain the spread of COVID-19.
President Buhari cited the statement of the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, that the moon has not been sighted, thus, suspending Eid congregational prayers across the country.
