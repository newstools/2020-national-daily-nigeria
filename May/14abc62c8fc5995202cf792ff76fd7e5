Yinusa Dahiru, who abducted and forcibly married and impregnated a Bayelsan girl Ese Oruru, in 2015 has been sentenced to 26 years in prison.
Justice Jane Inyang gave the judgement on Thursday.in Yenegia.
Ese, now a mother was 14 years old when Dahiru took her from her mother’s shop to Kano where he converted her to Islam before impregnating and keeping in Kano’s Emir palace. The deposed Emir Sanuai Lamido was on throne then—and was out to Mecca for lesser hajj when it happened..
On February 29, 2016, Ese was rescued by the Kano State police which handed her to the Bayelsa government. She was already five months gone then.
A month later, Dahiru was arraigned before the Federal High Court, Yenagoa, on four charges: criminal abduction, illicit sex, sexual exploitation and unlawful carnal knowledge of the minor.
Dahiru, a tricycle rider in Yenegoa, had claimed the girl was in love and that was why she eloped with him.
Justice Jane acquitted Dahiru on count one but jailed him five years (count two), seven years (count three) seven years (count four) and seven years, (count five).
The judgement will run concurrently.
