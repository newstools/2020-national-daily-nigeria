Former Brazil international Filipe Melo, in a game against Argentina, found a way to stop Messi as Brazil won 3-1 in Rosario. Melo says that he will tell his children and grandson about that game because it was a game that he and his teammates stopped Messi.

However, Melo has said that trying to stop Messi or kick him out of a game doesnâ€™t work because the Argentine is a resilient player, and he is in the top three players in football history.

And there are many who think that is an Insult. Because they believe Messi is the best after 6 Ballon Dor.
