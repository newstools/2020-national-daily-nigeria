There was internal resistance to speedy passage of the controversial infectious disease control bill by some members of the House of representatives when the bill was presented last week. The sponsors of the bill had plotted early passage of the bill without elaborate deliberations and debates by the lawmakers. It was also revealed that even at the time the bill was rolled past the first and second reading, and was being pushed for third reading passage, most lawmakers had not got copies of the bill. Apparently, the bill would have been passed in the dark. The move was resisted within the House before the public outcry that dented the contents.
Nkem Abonta was identified to be vocal in opposing the speedy early passage of the controversial bill. The lawmaker had at the last week plenary on Tuesday, admonished members of the House to be cautious and have restraint in the speedy passage of the bill, particularly, when the bill was not yet circulated to all members.
Abonta aligned with the populist fear that the bill will give too much powers to the Director General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC); citing the compulsory vaccination of Nigerians [as excessive power].
Abonta had contended that the compulsory vaccination will be tantamount to infringement on the human rights of citizens. He advocated for the suspension of the till members study and understand the full content of the controversial bill.
According to him, the bill is a long-term measure against diseases in the country and not for the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic.
However, Gbajabiamila, the lead sponsor of the bill, ensured the bill passed through the first and second readings by fiat in defiance to majority dissenting voices in the House during voice vote.
