Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, on Monday decried the failure of many Nigerians to comply strictly with the guidelines for easing the lockdown in Lagos and the FCT.
Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), the PTF Chairman, at the PTF briefing on Monday, noted that close monitoring of activities on Monday revealed that the level of compliance is unsatisfactory, especially, with regards to social distancing, and the use of fabric face masks.
Boss Mustapha expressed fear that the crowd at the various banks constitute serious threat to the containment of the spread of coronavirus in the country.
Lamenting the high level of violation of the lockdown easing guidelines, Boss Mustapha expressed concerns that interstate travel ban has also not been compiled with. He stated that the evacuation of almajiris from different states does not respect the guidelines nor follow the rule of the ban.
The PTF Chairman directed that enforcement agencies do their jobs effectively and bring violators to book. The SGF, however, called on security agencies not to take laws into their hands, but follow the rule of law in carrying out their duties.
He stated that great improvements have been made, especially, in manpower development, in tackling the crisis in Kano State. He added that collaboration with Kano State is still in focus, saying that results coming out of the state show that expected outcomes will be seen at the end of the day.
