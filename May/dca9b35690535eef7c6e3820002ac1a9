Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state has vowed that the same way he came to power in 2016 is the same way he would return to power, noting that only God can give power, and not human beings.
Obaseki who expressed this optimism while appearing on Channels Television programme, Sunrise Daily on Wednesday, disclosed that God brought him into power, and that as far as God is alive, and wants him to return, no man can stop him from completing his eight years as duly elected governor of Edo state.
“I worked for eight years behind the scene to develop Edo State before I became the governor. I don’t want to get the party’s ticket at all cost. I’m not a violent person and I’m confident of getting back.”
“Someone brought me into power. I know who gave me power. God is the one that gave me power. As far as God is alive, and wants me to return, no man can stop me. The way I came into power, that same way, I will return. Power belongs to God.”
Speaking on the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary scheduled for June, Obaseki said election should not lead to bloodshed, adding that his team has always canvassed for peace in Edo State, and that democracy should be able to resolve all the issues on ground.
His optimism is coming amid hightened plots by a group of the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to national Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, to deny him the party’s ticket.
The group is said to have adopted Osagie Ize-Iyamu to become the flagbearer of the party for the coming governorship election in the state on September 19.
The recent announcement of the party leadership that the APC would adopt direct primary for the party primary in Edo by June, had been interpreted by many observers of Edo State politics, as a plot targeted to work against Obaseki’s return to power.
