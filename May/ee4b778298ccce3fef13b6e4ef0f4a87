The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has alleged the mass movement of IS West Africa members into Edo state, urging Nigerians to prepare in new video.
In the video obtained by National Daily, a chieftain of IPOB who simply identified himself as Simon Ekpa, said the incident happened on the 15thÂ of May.
In the video, dozens of identified men were observed trooping out from an unmarked truck along the Benin Bypass, and were seen being led across a part into the town.
