The family of abducted former Commissioner for Youth and Sport in Edo state, Mr. Presley Ediagbonya, who is said to been killed by his abductors on Monday, says the kidnapped politician is still alive and not dead as being alleged.
Ediagbonya, who was a one-time local government chairman and had also served as Deputy Chief of Staff to the Edo State government, was abducted at his farm last week in Ovia North-East Local Government Area of the state.
It will be recalled that when contacted on phone Monday night, the state police command spokesman, DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, had said: “Speculations on the death is still sketchy because I am yet to be briefed. When I am briefed, I will come up with a detailed statement to members of the public.”
A family of the abducted politician who craved for anonymity on Tuesday described Ediagbonya’s death report as hasty, noting that the abductors requested for N10 million ransom and the family members pleaded for N5 million.
“The abductors thereafter asked us to pay the ransom at a location in Asaba, Delta State; and we complied. Few hours later, the abductors sent the family text message that our brother had been killed. So, what I am saying is that the abductors only claimed they have killed my brother, but by the grace of God, I know he will come out alive.”
Meanwhile, the state police command said it has deployed its operatives to comb the forests of Ogbese and Okada, Ovia North-East local government area of the State, in search of kidnappers of Ediagbonya.
It was gathered that the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Lawan Jimeta, deployed the team to ensure that the APC leader is rescued unhurt.
