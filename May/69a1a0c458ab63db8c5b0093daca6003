Popular ragamuffin singer Daddy Showkey hit a rough patch in 2007, and things went awry for him for years—until lately he started inching his way out of misery.
His throne-to-trash-and-back-to-the-throne story told on Instagram highlights disappointment by friends after he had an accident that put paid to his music career.Among the fairweather friend are 25 buddies rom his Ajegunle ghetto.
He said he bought a car for each of them, add stuffed N2 million in each had when he was making money in sackfuls.
According to him, the accident occurred on his way back from a birthday bash by another singer, Olu Maintain, in 2007. He was thereafter hospitalized abroad for three years.
“When I come back, the people wey go come meet me, I go dash the millions, when I go their house, them go tell their gateman make them lock gate, make the gateman tell me say dem no dey,” he narrated in pidgin during a live chat shared byFasanmi Abiola on Facebook.
By then, based on medical advice, he had already stopped his ghetto music and back-racking galala dance that shot him to fame. That meant he went broke.
He relocated to Warri where he had to learn a new business, and became a wage slave.
“I had to tell my friends that I was going to Warri, Delta. I began to struggle again. I started working with a man and started working as a labourer carrying pan. I forgot that I was Daddy Showkey. All these happened in 2010,” he said.
“I sold my pride. Many people were laughing at me without knowing what I was going through. But I was optimistic that I would rise again,”
He eventually met Lady Fortuna—again. His struggles and rakings added up to N3 million, he explained.
So things began to look up again.
