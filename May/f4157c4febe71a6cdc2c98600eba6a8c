A Colombian transgender model has posted a heartwarming photo of her kissing her husband’s eight-month baby bump.

Danna Sultana, who was born male and identifies as female, is expecting a baby with Esteban Landrau, who was born a woman but identifies as a man.

Taking to Instagram, the model shared the adorable image with her 219,000 followers earlier this month, along with the hashtag ‘Love Is Love’. The besotted couple conceived their baby naturally, as both Danna and Esteban still have their natural organs, local media reported.

Transgender history, in the broadest sense, includes examples of gender variance and gender nonconformity in cultures worldwide since ancient times. As this history is prior to the coining of the modern term “transgender”, opinions of how to categorize these people and identities can vary. This history also begins prior to the mid-twentieth-century usage of “gender” in American psychology and associated conceptual apparatus including the notions of “gender identity” and “gender role”.

Sumerian and Akkadian texts from 4500 years ago document transgender or transvestite priests known as gala and by other names. In the Americas prior to European colonization, as well as in some contemporary cultures, some North American Indigenous cultures traditionally recognize third gender or multi-gender roles, such as the Navajo nádleehi gender spectrum or the Zuni lhamana. Graves of possibly trans- or third-gender people in Europe and America have been identified from 4500 years ago, and likely depictions occur in art around the Mediterranean from 9000 to 3700 years ago.
