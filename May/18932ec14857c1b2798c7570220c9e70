President Muhammadu Buhari may finally unveil his new CoS, weeks after his former right-hand man Abba Kyari died from Covid-19 complications.
The new man, as the story trends on social media, is Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, from Kwara, north-central Nigeria.
Gambari was, in the past, a lot—a scholar, former diplomat, former minister, and ex-VC of the Kwara State University. He had a long spell working with the UN, the AU (NEPAD). He founded the Savannah Centre, a thik tank operating in Abuja.
If it eventually happens as speculated, Gambari is now the man that will be running Buhari’s backroom—at 75.
There has been no official reaction to the news of the appointment which broke out on Twitter Tuesday afternoon.
