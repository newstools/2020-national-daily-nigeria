In a series of tweets, the commissioner said the reports were circulated to create panic and unnecessary anxiety among people of the State.
“#COVID19Lagos News AlertSpeaker with three sound waves,” tweeted Thursday.
“I hereby implore the general public to disregard the fake and misleading news circulating in the media to the effect that I have tested positive to #COVID19 infection.
“It is evident that the fake news is calculated at causing panic and unnecessary anxiety amongst the populace.
“I therefore urge the public to disregard any news on #COVID19 that does not emanate from @followslasg official communication channels and other verifiable sources.
“Remain vigilant and continue to play your part as responsible citizens in curtailing the spread of #COVID19 in our communities.”
