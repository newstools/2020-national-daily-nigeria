Barely weeks after losing his uncle, President Muhammadu Buhari has lost another family member, this time, it was his nephew, Alhaji Ibrahim Dauda.
It would be recalled that on May 8, 2020, President Buhari lost his younger uncle, Alhaji Mutari Dauda Daura.
Mutari Dauda Daura was the younger brother of 81 year-old Malam Mamman Daura, the President’s uncle.
National Daily gathered that the late Dauda died in Daura, Katsina State, following a prolonged illness.
In a condolence message, President Buhari said the death has robbed the family and the Daura community of one of its finest gentlemen.
“I am deeply touched and devastated by the passing of yet another family member, a man who had demonstrated amazing kindness and honesty in all his dealings,” the President said.
He prayed God to forgive the soul of the deceased and reward his great and noble deeds with paradise.
The deceased is survived by a number of children, including Dauda Ibrahim, a Chief Administrative Officer in State House, Abuja.
