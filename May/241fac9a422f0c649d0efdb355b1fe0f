The Nigerian Railway Corporation has said it is now compulsory for its workers and other people coming to the NRC premises to use face masks.
Managing Director of the corporation, Fidet Okhira, stated this in Lagos while inaugurating a safety campaign programme as part of efforts to control the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria.
Apart from using face masks, he also said hand washing and the social distancing practices would be strictly enforced along with temperature readings of individuals at the entry points as outlined by the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control.
A statement by the Deputy Director, Public Relations at the
NRC, Yakub Mahmood, quoted Okhiria as saying, “Healthy workforce is an asset for any organisation because it is only healthy workers that can perform optimally towards the production output with profound efficiency.”
He said the board and management of the NRC had immense concern for the health and well-being of workers and their families.
He said the sensitisation programme starting with the NRC headquarters and Ebute-Meta Junction would be carried out in all the districts of the corporation.
He appealed to the people to always cooperate with the NRC front-line personnel who would subject them to body temperature measurement at the entry points of the NRC facilities.
Deputy Director of Research, Health, Safety and Environment at the NRC, Mr Oyekunle Oyewole, who represented the Director of Corporate Planning, Mr, James Gyang, told the MD that the campaign would last for two days.
The NRC had earlier on embarked on decontamination of its offices, workshops, residential quarters and train stations in the entire system, all towards achieving healthy environment in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.
