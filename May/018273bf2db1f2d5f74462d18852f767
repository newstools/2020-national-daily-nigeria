Ex-International and former National team  Coach,Daniel Amokachi has recently revealed that Chinedu Obasi claims late Stephen Keshi dropped  him from the team because he refused to pay bribe,he should have come forward with the accusation when he was alive.
Amokachi told National Daily  that why will Obasi come forward with such when the man in charge is no longer alive to answer it? even look at it, this happen in 2014 and six years after you are coming forward with such claims? why wait till now?
The Bull explained that it doesn’t make sense to say such an issue when the head coach is no longer alive to respond to you. am not saying this things don’t happen. especially in Africa Football, but for us to have a change, when such happen, come forward with it on time.
Former S.Eagles coach said that be the sacrifice so as to prevent others going through the experience. It is not about one person, it is a revolution that will change the entire Football system this issue of bribe taking or collecting money in our Football is not a one way thing.
He concluded that agent of players will come and meet a coach to offer money for their players to be selected, at times players are the ones that will even go to the coach to say my agent said he is ready to pay for me to be part of the team.
