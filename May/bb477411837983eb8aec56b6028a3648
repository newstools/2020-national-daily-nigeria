The Lagos State House of Assembly 7-Man Ad-Hoc Committee on dredging  has commenced the inspection on illegal dredging in the State on Tuesday with the Commissioner for Waterfront and Infrastructure, Mr. Ahmed Kabiru Abdullahi , other Staff of the Ministry and LASUWA.

The Committee visited the shore lines of Banana Island and Parkview Estate with a bid to do on-spot assessment of the dredging activities in that area.

The committee led by hon. Victor Akande observed that there are illegal building extensions with no approval from State Government and lots of seemingly faulty dredging machines abandoned in the lagoon  which makes navigation difficult for boat riders due to the narrowing.

He further expressed that private jetty owners should be checkmated to ensure that boats are  licensed and not used for  criminal and illegal activities.

Other Members who were present are:Hon.(Engr.) David Setonji, Hon. Richard Kasumu, Hon. Ajani Owolabi.

The inspection exercise is to continue for the rest of the week.
