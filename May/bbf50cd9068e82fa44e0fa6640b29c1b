Femi Fani-Kayode has berated the Managing Director of Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe for sacking hundreds of staff after giving the Federal Government N1 billion to fight Coronavirus.

Access Bank had given the Federal Government N1 billion to wage war against Coronavirus. But the bank, few days ago allegedly laid off lots of staff, citing economic downturn arising from Coronavirus lockdown as the reason.
The bank also cut the salaries of staff of the bank, as part of measures to stay afloat.
Fani-Kayode, reacting to the development said it was foolishness for Access Bank to give FG N1 billion to fight COVID-19 and the next day sacked hundreds of loyal staff.
In his words: “You gave 1 Billion Naira to the FG to fight COVID-19 & the next day you sacked hundreds of your loyal staff.
“You betrayed your workers and turned your back on them when they needed you most because you were more interested in your profits and appeasing Buhari. SHAME ON U!
“Worse still, you shut down 340 of your branches! With a stroke of the pen you have thrown thousands of people into unemployment at a time when they are already going through hell because of the lockdown and you have destroyed many families. Herbert Wigwe, how do you sleep at night?”
