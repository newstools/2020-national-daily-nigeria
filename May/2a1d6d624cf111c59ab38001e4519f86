I was confused and had to call my mother ,i  explained everything to her and she asked me what do I really want. I told her I wanted something more in my career and wanted to win trophies as a player.
River Angels Star player said her mother told her to follow her heart.  I arrived Port Harcourt the next day, had my medicals two days after, left the hotel and joined the other players at the team’s camp.
Everyone at Rivers Angels treated me with so much respect and I felt at home almost immediately. I will never forget what the Team Manager told me in our first meeting. She told me this  is an environment where everyone is welcome and treated equally. If you are motivated and want to help us win more trophies, then you’ve got a place here at Rivers Angels”.
She concluded that “I have never regretted joining Rivers Angels, and will forever be grateful to God Almighty and my mother who was the only person that encouraged me to join the ‘Jewels Of Rivers’.”
