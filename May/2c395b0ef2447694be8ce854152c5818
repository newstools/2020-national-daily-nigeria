A Non Governmental Organization otherwise known as the West African Network for Peace (WANEP) and Centre for Peace Advancement in Nigeria (CEPAN), has donated a blue and black colour facemasks that matches the Police uniform to the Nigerian Police.

The facemask numbering over 300 are to support the police vulnerability as front line workers in this challenging times of the dreaded coronavirus pandemic, says the Executive Director CEPAN, Rev. Samuel Goro.

“The facemask is to support the Police during arrest of offender and defaulters of violators of government policies during the lockdown and restrictions of movement. The facemask is also comes handy to the officers when they evacuate dead bodies found on the streets”, Goro said.

Making the donation yesterday in Jos, the NGO said it also became imperative to support Jos North Local Government Area with the product as the LGA records the highest number of infected persons in the State.

The distribution of the mask, supported by the United States Institutes of Peace (USIP), under the Justice and Security Dialogue (JSD), is however an effort to sustain and improve the relationship between security providers and citizens, says Mr. Goro.

“Our effort has also helped civilians and security operatives to become more effective, accountable, and responsive to community needs”, he said.

Responding, the Commissioner of Police, CP Edward Egbuka, said the gesture will be matched with action, by improving service delivery to citizens.

Egbuka represented by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Warebi Owotorufa, said without the inputs of the civil society organizations, the Police will hardly succeed in its duty to protect lives and properties.
