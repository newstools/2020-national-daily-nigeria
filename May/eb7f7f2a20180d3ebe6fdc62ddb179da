And painfully, the Belgian captain’s injury woes have left virtually all madridistas disappointed as they have exercised great expectations from his magical boots.
Interestingly, their star man is finally back and the former Chelsea forward who has not hidden his joy of returning to training with his Real Madrid team-mates aims to be fully fit once La Liga resumes.
Ironically, the football’s suspension may have come at a good time for Hazard, who was set to miss around two months with a fractured ankle.
Hazard in a video on Real Madrid’s Twitter account said: “Very good to be back on the pitch to work with the boys. We now just have to wait for the games but I’m very happy.
“After two months out, I need more fitness and more [training] with the ball. So, I just want to be ready for the next game.”
Real Madrid fans can only wish and hope that their star remains out injury woes going forward.
