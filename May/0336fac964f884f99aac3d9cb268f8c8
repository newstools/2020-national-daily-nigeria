Dear Joeboy & Fireboy,

Apologies!

Ahead.

As I delve into this nonsense we love doing as bad habits — comparism.

But someone called me up to do this. He wants to know who’s better.

Most importantly he wanted me to do it the Instetters way. So here I go.

Cobhams Asuquo, the music producer said this about Fireboy, real name Adedamola Adefolaha, “Fireboy is hot right now. Fireboy is the truth.  Fireboy is special to me. He has a body of work that I feel like he makes the effort to make every song a potential hit song.  He is a good song writer. He is a true artiste.  He is a great singer.  He is a consummate musician.   I think I like them all but Fireboy is special to me, in my own opinion, in my own personal like. Like what you like. But I like Fireboy”.

So Cobhams prefers him over Joeboy.

In the same way. I have my own preference.

Joeboy is the real deal to me. I think he is just so unique and I love all his songs.

For me, it’s Joeboy, real names Akinfewa-Donus Joseph.

I think both of them are doing great though.

Olamide doesn’t just put his money on just about any artistes. Out of the millions of persons wanting the YBNL Boss’s attention. It was definitely the magical talents of Fireboy that gets Olamide’s signature.

Same thing though for Joeboy. Out of 10,000 applicants from 14 countries, Joeboy emerged. He got Mr Eazi’s attention.

Now it seams you must know how to sing well if you have BOY in your name — Joeboy, Fireboy, Burnaboy e.t.c.

Your Boy spotter,
Ediale
