The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has denied media reports linking its officers to the rift between security personnel where a soldier was allegedly beaten up in Benin City on Saturday during the ongoing enforcement of coronavirus lockdown order by the state government.
It was reported that the rift ensued between a Police Officer and a Soldier (though on mufti) after the soldier allegedly refused to wear a face mask.
NSCDC declared in a statement on Sunday: “To set the record straight, there is no Civil Defence officer that is involved in the unfortunate incident among the security men in Benin-City between 1.00 pm and 1:30 pm at the popular Lagos Street/Oba Market Street junction in downtown Benin, the allegation is false and a calculated attempt to smear the image of the Corps and existing synergy between Corps and Nigeria Army.
“There has been a lot of talk that the security agencies don’t get along,” that is not the case between Civil Defence and Nigerian Army, both agencies have the same spirit, the spirit of defending the country.
“As a citizen’s friendly organization, we are very civil in our operations. And base on the order of the Commandant General of the Corps, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu, no personnel should carry arms during Covid 19 lockdown/curfew enforcement. This is being adhered to nationwide.”
It was stated that the Commandant General appreciate the media in the country for collaborating with the Corps in discharging their duty.
Commandant General has, however, immediately directed a full-scale investigation into the matter.
