The Cleric who is popularly called Pastor Chris spoke during his ministration at the ongoing nightly broadcast of Your Loveworld on Saturday, May 23, 2020, which is widely watched on YouTube, Facebook and several other online, satellite, terrestrial networks and radio stations across the world. He said: “There are Pastors who are impoverished by this situation/crisis. There’s no way that you can know all of them, but some of them were brought into very desperate circumstances. They have no food, no money, nothing! This week, I want us to do something if we can find them, if we can get to know who and where they are.”
