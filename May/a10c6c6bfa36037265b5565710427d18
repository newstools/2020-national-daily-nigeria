The assets of many top Nigeria billionaires have been adversely affected since the global outbreak of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown of Nigeria’s economy to curb the spread.
By the end of February, Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote controls shareholding worth over N2.4 trillion in Dangote Cement alone, however by the end of March, the price of the shares had dropped from N170 per share to N129.70 and later N130 by the end of April
At this time, Dangote’s indirect shares were worth N3,593,542,810 while his direct shares were worth N1,885,041,015,130 summing up to N1,888,634,557,940 (over N1.8 trillion).
By comparing N 2,469,752,883,460, the value as at February 29, with N1,888,634,557,940 as at April 30, we can see that the billionaire’s assets in Dangote Cement Plc crashed by N 581,118,325,520 (N581 billion).
For Chairman of United Bank for Africa Plc, Tony Elumelu, he owns a total of 190,100,234 units of shares in the bank, and 2,114,110,884 units of indirect shareholding in the company.
By the close of trading on February 29, UBA’s shares were worth N6.7, meaning Elumelu’s total stocks in the bank was worth N15,438,214,490.6 (N15.43 billion).
There was not much movement in the share values for UBA plc as it started N6.7 on February 29 and ended April at N6.05. This means that by April 30, Elumelu shares (multiplied by the share price of N6.05 per unit) were worth N13,940,477,263.9 (N13.94 billion), showing a loss of N1,497,737,226.7 (N1.49 billion).

As at February ending, Ovia’s total 5,059,336,405 units of shares were worth N93.59 billion at the share price of N18.5 per unit. By April 30, following the crash in prices, the worth of the same shares had dropped to N72.35 billion. Subtracting the latter value from the first, one can see that the worth of Jim Ovia’s stocks dropped by a whopping N21.2 billion (N21, 249,212,901).
Access Bank’s Group CEO, Herbert Wigwe had a total shareholding of 1,441,522,910 units as at December 2019, before selling off a total of 55,611,001 indirect shares in four transactions, all in January 2020.

Share prices of Access bank closed at N8,2 on February 29 and dropped to N6.6 on April 30. His 1.39 billion shares were worth N 11,364,477,653.80 on February 29, and crashed by 19% to become N 9,147,018,599.40 on April 30.
Having dispensed of a few shares in 2019, co-founder of Seplat Austin Avuru ended the year with 58,970,463 indirect shares in the oil and gas company.
Avuru’s shares, when multiplied by the share price of N605 gives a naira value of N 35,677,130,115 as of February 29.
Taking it two months forward, a stock price of N494.4 as at April 30 shows that the value had depleted to N29, 154,996,907.20. Avuru lost about N6.5 billion (N 6,522,133,207.80) to the stock price decline.
Mike Adenuga is the Chairman Of Conoil Nigeria Plc, and directly owns 516,298,603 units of shares. He also has 103,259,720 units of indirect shares through Conpetro Limited, making for about 74.4% of Conoil’s issued share capital.
Conoil’s stock prices started at N18 per unit and only dropped a little to close at N17.4 on April 30.
Multiplying Adenuga’s 103,259,720 indirect shares by the stock price of N18 gives us a naira value of N1.86 billion (N 1,858,674,960) as at February ending, but the slight decline in stock value reduced the worth of these shares to N1.79 billion.
Adenuga lost N61.9 million (N61,955,832) in his indirect shares to the COVID-19 crisis.
The 516,298,603 direct shares fell from N9.29 billion (N9,293,374,854) to N8.9 billion (N8,983,595,692.2) by end of April—a difference of N309 million.
