For the second time since the fight against Covid-19 began Feb 27, Anabra’s ex-Gov. Peter Obi has never hidden his support for certain steps President Muhammadu Buhari has been taking, though Obi’s party PDP might not like them.
In reaction to the president’s decision to ship in Madagascar Covid-Organics, Obi emphasized his support for the move.
“I firmly support the authorisation of @MBuhari for importation and subjection of the Madagascar #COVID19 Syrup to standard validation process for pharmaceuticals, and possibly for use in the cure of this virus, Obi tweeted on Monday.
He had commended Buhari for locking down Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja in April, blaming some southeastern governors playing politics with the pandemic.
The former governor particularly supported the latest move because it encouraged local solution to containing the virus. 
“Similar authorisation and encouragement should be given to local inventions. This will save us scarce forex and will give confidence to domestic researchers and inventors.”
The consignment will arrive Nigeria en route from Equatorial Guinea.
