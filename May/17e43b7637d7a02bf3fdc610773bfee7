APC’s chairman Adams Oshiomhole has been indicted by the Judicial Commission of Inquiry Governor Godwin Obaseki set up to investigate the construction of the Edo Specialist Hospital and supply of equipment.
The former governor may face prosecution, according to the panel, which said he breached the state’s procurement law.
Chairman of the commission, Justice James Oyomire (rtd), presented the report of the findings to Obaseki at the Government House in Benin, on Thursday.
Oyomire pointed out that the procurement law states that any contractor working on a government project should not receive more than 25 per cent upfront payment.
“The immediate past administration paid 75 per cent of the contract sum upfront for the project to Vamed Engineering”, he stated.
The commission empowers the Ministry of Justice to institute civil and criminal actions against those found culpable in the breach of the law.
Gov. Obaseki vowed that anyone found culpable, no matter how highly-placed, will be asked to account for their action.
“We have been putting the right measures in place and if there are resources of government that need to be returned back, we will not hesitate to ask for it,” he said.
Obaseki ws part of the Oshiomhole administration he is probing now.
