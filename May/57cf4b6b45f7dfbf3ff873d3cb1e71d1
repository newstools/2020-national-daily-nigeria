Nigerian singer and song writer, Wurld has opened up being the brain behind Davido’s hit single, “Blow My Mind”.

In an explosive interview  the singer narrated how he wanted Mr Eazi and Wande Coal and Runtown.

Wurld grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, US, said that the song “blow my mind” was written in 2017.

Wurld said: “I created ‘Blow My Mind’ in 2017. I sent the song to Mr. Eazi and Wande Coal to do a second verse. Runtown also had a verse. In 2019, Shizzi then told me that Davido wanted the record. I was promoting Love Is Contagious at the time and after we went back and forth a bit, we agreed. I mean, he had Chris Brown on it (laughs).”

Yesterday, he released his third EP in two years, ‘Afro-Soul.’ Wurld released his first EP titled, Love Is Contagious in 2018.
