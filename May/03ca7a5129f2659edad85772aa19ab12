Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has ordered the treatment of coronavirus cases with chloroquine and Zithromax in the state. He
Governor Mohammed who once tested positive to coronavirus but recovered and later tested negative, insisted that from personal experience, he has strong belief in the efficacy and effectiveness of drugs; directing health personnel to ignore warnings from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other health specialists overseas.
The Governor had at a media briefing on Wednesday assured his acceptance of responsibility for the consequences of the drugs in the treatment of coronavirus in Bauchi State.
The World Health Organization (WHO) had doubted the efficacy of the drugs in treating coronavirus, arguing that thereâ€™s no definitive evidence that Chloroquine, and derivative hydroxychloroquine are effective in the treatment of coronavirus which the global health supervisor consistently maintains that it has no treatment yet. The argument of WHO is flawed by the rate of recoveries from coronavirus across the world. Those articulating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as therapies for coronavirus appear to be winning the debate.
