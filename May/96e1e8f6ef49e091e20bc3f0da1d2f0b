A new terrorist cell Jama’atu Ansaril Muslimina fi Biladis Sudan or the Vanguard for the Protection of Muslims in Black Africa had been operating in northeastern, and the federal government just knew it.
The group, police say, specializes in kidnap and ransom, and has been killing people in the region largely dominated by Boko Haram, the world’s bloodiest terrorists group until ISIS.
Before the Inspector-General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari, uncovered the group, JAMBS has been terrorizing companies and multinational operating in the region, levying them N50 million monthly.
It actually kidnapped—for ransom— two expatriates working with Triacta Nigeria Limited, a construction company in Kaduna. They attacked Mothercat, too.
Couples of violent Islamic extremist groups have splintered off Boko Haram since 2015, and the groups have been competing for resources and livelihood by taxing and levying citizens living in the conquered territories.
