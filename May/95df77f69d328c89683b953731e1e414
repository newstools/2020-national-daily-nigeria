E-money, one of the young billionaires under Forbes radar, is now a person of interest for the Nigerian police.
Less known as Emeka Okwonkwo, the chairman of Fiver Star Group, overreached himself when he apparently turned the men of the Nigerian Police securing him into house helps. 
IGP Mohammed Adam was worried and surprised a private citizen could do that to an instrument of state. The police boss ordered the withdrawal of the six policemen attached to E-money, and moved the police to investigate the source of wealth of the businessman.
Among other businesses, clearing and forwarding seems the most prominent of the means through which E-money might have come to riches. He’s also into music production, having on his label his brother Kingsley Okwonkwo aka K-Cee.
E-money is mostly likely well known for his gorgeous lifestyle and do-gooding. Especially on Facebook where he dismayed his wealth and large heartedness.
So it was no surprise his police security details became bellhops and push buttons, fetching and carrying things like umbrellas for the rich kid and his wife.
“The policemen were discovered to be attached to B Operations at the command headquarters and not MOPOL which is the usual practice. So, we have withdrawn his policemen and we are inviting him for questioning. The policemen will also be interrogated,” The Punch quoted a police source as saying.
Nigeria has less than 400,000 police officers, a figure below the standard when compared with Nigeria’s population—over 200 million.
