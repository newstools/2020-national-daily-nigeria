The Federal Government has reacted to reports alleging that it has fixed re-opening of schools across the nation on June 8 after months of closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba on Wednesday during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, described the reports as untrue.
According to him, “The material that the Chairman of the PTF spoke about, which is an announcement purportedly from him that we are reopening all schools on the 8th did not emanate from us.
“That is not true… Until we are sure that these children can go to school, return safely, and not bring home with them this COVID-19 material, then infect people who are more susceptible to the disease than they are, then we are running a huge risk,” Nwajiuba said.
According to him, the government would not be taking any risk yet, saying it was going to prepare as much as possible before reopening schools.
“We are not taking that risk yet. We are going to prepare as much as possible within the guidance they (Presidential Task Force) offer us with their expertise in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, before we re-open schools,” Nwajiuba said.
