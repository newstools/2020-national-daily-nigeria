From the line-up of Instagram celebrities, one could already tell that the Peak breakfast table talk was going to be something not to miss. The online breakfast show which ended on the 28th of April saw Nigeria’s popular Instagram comedians and personalities share exciting details about their lock-down experience while taking their audience through the process of preparing their favourite nourishing Peak breakfast recipes
Hosted on Peak’s Instagram page, the live shows featured personalities like Lasisi Elenu, Tomike, Temisan, Kie Kie, and Elozonam – who excited their followers with fun and educative conversations about healthy nutrition and diligently observing the lockdown directive. They also prompted their followers to recreate the breakfast meals as seen during the Instagram live conversations.
Also, in line with this commitment to nourishing Nigerians and helping them reach their peak, the dairy giant partnered with the government to support over 100,000 low-income families across the country who are at risk of compromising their nutritional needs with relief packages of Peak dairy products to help them stay nourished while they stay safe at home. The brand also partnered with several Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) including Lagos Food Bank, Bayo Omoboriowo Foundation, made Great by God Foundation, Tahara Collective, and Mothers Outreach; providing relief another 27,000 families comprising low-income earners, vulnerable children and healthcare practitioners at the infectious disease hospital (IDH) Yaba and Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).
In the spirit of Ramadan, Peak is also working with NGOs to supply dairy products to Muslims with relatively inadequate means of income – ensuring they stay nourished during the month of devotion.
Having urged Nigerians for over 60 years to reach for their peak, Peak is reaching out and showing their support to Nigerians in so many impactful ways.
