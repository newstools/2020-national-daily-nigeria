Lionel Messi is arguably one of the best players to have played the game of football.
However, it is rather appalling that the Argentine talisman is yet to pick any major trophy with his senior national team.
Interestingly, the 32-year-old and six-time Balon d’Or award winner is slated to lead his native Argentina to this summer’s Copa America where he is hoping to finally conquer his continent with his national team.
Disappointingly, the Barcelona attacker who is already 32 years has sadly seen the Copa America tournament which would have been a second chance for him to play in a ‘home’ tournament having also been a part of La Albiceleste’s squad when they last hosted the tournament in 2011 postponed.
Understandably, the Argentine captain has not hidden his disappointment at the painful development that has seen the 47th edition of the competition to find South America’s best footballing nation which was due to take place this summer, postponed till after another 12 months.
Though the hosts would remain the same with matches slated to be played in both Colombia and Argentina.
Lionel Messi will now have to wait a little while longer to enjoy such an honour again and a possible avenue to finally pick up a major trophy with his senior national team, which the Barcelona captain has revealed to have led to a feeling of sadness.
Meanwhile, with countries around the world still feeling the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the legendary forward admits postponing the competition was the right thing to do.
“Pushing back the Copa América was a huge disappointment, but of course it was to be expected and was the reasonable thing to do,” he told Adidas’ Mindfulness Matters series.
“The Copa was going to be a big occasion for me this year, and I was extremely excited to compete in it again.
“It hit me hard when I learned it would be postponed, but I completely understood.”
