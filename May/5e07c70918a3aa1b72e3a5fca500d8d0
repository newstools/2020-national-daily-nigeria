MFM FC defender Kabiru Moshood has frowned at the method at which the Lagos-based club applied a pay cut on the players’ salary without informing them ahead,National Daily learnt.
The MFM FC defender explained that the club had slashed their salaries with a certain percentage without prior information or deliberation.
“We have it in our contract that the club should inform us before taken any deductions on salaries.”
“We are aware some clubs were also given a pay cut, clubs like Jigawa, but in our own case, we were not informed that they will give us pay cut rather they went ahead and implement it,’ Moshood said.
“If not because the rest of the team started complaining about the matter, we wouldn’t have known about it.”
“They later informed us that the outstanding will be paid in due time.”
