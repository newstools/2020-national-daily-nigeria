The Director General of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, at the Media Briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja on Wednesday denied allegations that NCDC staff are collecting money from citizens for the conduct of coronavirus test. The question was thrown at the NCDC DG to clarify the allegation that NCDC staff are collecting N35,000 from people in Abuja before conducting coronavirus tests on them. The DG refuted that the NCDC has not given any order for payment before coronavirus test is conducted on citizens, maintaining that coronavirus test is free for citizens though the bill is paid by government.
While disputing the allegation of N35,000 payment for coronavirus test in the country, the NCDC DG did not make any firm statement on what Nigerians should do if they fall victim of such practice anywhere in the country. In fact, there was no deterrent statement that will discourage the NCDC staff from such practice. Every other member of the PTF, including the PTF Chairman, Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, was also silent on the N35,000 payment allegation. There was no strong statement warning of punitive actions against anyone caught collecting N35,000 from Nigerians before conducting coronavirus test on the person.
