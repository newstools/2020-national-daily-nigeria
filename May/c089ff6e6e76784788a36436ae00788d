Willard Caroll Smith has worked hard all his life—from 12 he became a rapper Prince to the time he ventured into acting comedy—The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Now he is the king of California. And he tries to live it out.
After two marriages, dozens of star-studded movies in Hollywood, and couple of Oscar’s nominations, Smith has settled down in world he has created for himself: a $42-million grand mansion in California.
The house features basketball courts, a tennis court, recording studio, large garage, and plenty of living space hemmed in with blossoming gardens.
