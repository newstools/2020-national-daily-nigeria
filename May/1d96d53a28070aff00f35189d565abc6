Controversial cross-dresser, Bobrisky takes to his social media page recalling a past conversation that had happened before his mother died 12 years ago.
2nd of April 2020 makes it the first day we’ve seen or heard anything similar to his mother ever since the male barbie had walked into the limelight and according to him, she died during the 2008 Hajj in Mecca.
Bobrisky recounted how he had told his mum not to go due to her bad health condition but as nature would have it, she left for Mecca and was later confirmed dead.
He wrote;
“When I tell people I look so much like my mum. That is my mum o ! She is so pretty. She died in Mecca  hajj 2008. She died 12yrs ago. I remember telling her not to go to hajj that yr because the doctor told us she has high blood pressure. She eventually went and died there. Dis soul here is my everything. I still cry sometimes thou because she loves me die !”
