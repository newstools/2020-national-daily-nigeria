Flair Aviation, a British company engaged in humanitarian service in Nigeria has flouted Nigeria’s airspace restriction order as set out by the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19.
The company was operating commercial flight when it was only permitted to carry out humanitarian flight in the country, according to Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika on Sunday via his Twitter handle, @hadisirika.
“COVID-19. Flair Aviation, a UK company, was given approval for humanitarian operations, but regrettably, we caught them conducting commercial flights. This is callous! Wrong time to try our resolve,” the minister tweeted.
The plane has been impounded.
A “maximum penalty” would also be imposed on the company, he said.
Since March, Nigeria has shut its air space to local and international operations to contain the spread of Covid-19 which was initially imported to the country.
