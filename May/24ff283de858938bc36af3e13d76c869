A fan had asked Simi if she could produce a song with Falz as she missed listening to their collaborations and Simi replied that she would think about it.
Another fan followed up the tweet with an inquiry of why she doesn’t do collaborations with Falz again and Simi replied, “We’re not a band lol”
Simi and Falz are known, both of them have collaborated on songs like “Jamb Questions”, “Soldier”, “Foreign” and they even released a joint EP called “Chemistry”.
Their friendship ignited relationship rumors with a lot of fans expecting them to marry.
Some people felt, Simi could have answered differently. They feel Falz must have seen his gigs with Simi as a brand and item. Now how can Falz forgive Simi with this kind of rejection?
Here are the tweets:
Belteshazzar @Eneshezie, “@SympLySimi you appatently stopped creating magic with falz why?  …”
   @Talisman_victor, “@SympLySimi I so so miss your collabos with falz,can i hear at least one after this covid-19 pandemic??”
