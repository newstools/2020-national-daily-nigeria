APC Govs Umar Ganduje and Nasir el-Rufai have fallen out for a while, apparently during the demotion of Kano former Emir Sanusi Lamido whom el-Rufai sympathized with by offering him series of appointment in Kaduna.
It was the beginning of a cold war then. It’s been heated up a degree or two now. And Covid-19, which has gone wild up north, especially in Kano and among almanjiris all over the north, is the fuel.
El-Rufai shipped out to Kano a truckload of the Islamic school kids mopped I Kaduna weeks ago, and a good number of them were already infeted by the time they got to their home state.
Ganduje also followed suit. And el-Rufai , according to Kano government, complained as Ganduje also trucked out almanjiris in Kano whose home state is Kaduna.
“Yes, some of the Almajiri that were brought from other States to Kano State were confirmed positive of the virus,” Ganduje said on Sunday.  “Some of them that were taken to other states were confirmed positive.”
Plateau, Bauchi, Jigawa, and others have been evacuating these kids to their home states despite the federal government regulation against inter-state travels.
“The only difference is that Kano State is not playing politics out of it and therefore did not come out to say that the children brought from Bauchi, brought from Plateau or brought from other States have tested positive,” said Ganduje.
“Certainly, what they need is not publicity, what they need is attention because the infection had already taken place. So there is nothing we can do about that.”
Gov. el-Rufai has been updating his state on the virality of the infection, making a specific point of the almanjiris.
