President Muhammadu Buhari may have continued to provide visible substances for critics to sustain accusing him of northernization policy in federal appointments as the president appoints Lamido Yuguda the new Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This further increased the number of federal parastatals being headed by northerners in the Buhari administration.
President Buhari, accordingly, communicated the appointment of Yuguda as DG SEC to the Senate for confirmation.
President Buhari’s request for confirmation via a letter was read by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, Senate at plenary on Tuesday.
Other appointments sent to the Senate for screening and confirmation as full-time Commissioners of the Commission include Reginald Karausa, Ibrahim Boyi, and Obi Joseph.
The letter reads: “Pursuant to Section 3 and 5(1) of the Investment and Securities Act 2007, I write to request for confirmation by the Senate, the appointment of the following four nominees as Director General and Commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
“Their CVs are attached herewith.”
