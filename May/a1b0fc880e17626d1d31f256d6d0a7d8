While state task forces and the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 have observed and reviewed the effectiveness of the phased effort to ease lockdown the federal government slammed on Lagos, Abuja, Ogun, the Lagos government has turned the decision-making to citizens.
According to the state government, voting became necessary because Lagosians have disregarded social distancing and other guidelines issued by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and health experts.
So on Tuesday, the state government tweeted, “Considering the level of compliance with government’s directives on limiting the spread of COVID-19 in Lagos State, should the state government impose another lockdown or not?”
More than 53,000 people voted yes or no or neutral as of Wednesday.
About 51.4 percent of respondents asked the state government to issue a fresh lockdown order while 37.2 votes against it. Other responders were undecided.
Although Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu earlier talked tough following citizens’ violation of the guidelines.
The online voting might just reinforce its decision.
But elsewhere, for instance, Los Angeles, the epicenter of the pandemic in California, health authorities deciding to lock down the city for three months based their decision on data and CDC guidelines—not what the citizens wanted.
