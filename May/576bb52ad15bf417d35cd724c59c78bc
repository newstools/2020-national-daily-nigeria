The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has identified certain deficiencies of cloth face mask in the prevention of the spread of coronavirus. The Centre, therefore, issued advisory instructions on the use of cloth face masks.
NCDC in a tweet via its official handle on Wednesday maintained that physical distancing is more effective in protecting the self from COVID-19.
The Centre explained that coronavirus primarily spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, noting that face mask alone is not the form of protection but additional response.
“Remember, cloth face masks are to be used as an additional layer of physical distancing; a mask alone cannot protect you from #COVID19
“Please continue to maintain a distance of 2 metres between yourself and others at all times to stay safe,” NCDC had stated.
The NCDC further encouiraged Nigerians to continue to wash their hands frequently, avoid large gatherings and adhere to other guidelines which are listed below;

Avoiding large gatherings.
Physical distancing by maintaining a distance of 2 metres between yourself and others.
Regular handwashing with soap under running water.
Frequent cleaning of surfaces with soap and water or disinfectants.

NCDC warned that cloth face masks should NOT be worn by individuals who are at high risk of coronavirus complications.
NCDC recommended that the following persons are advised to wear MEDICAL face masks instead of cloth face masks.

Health care workers and those caring for the ill.
Those experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing.
