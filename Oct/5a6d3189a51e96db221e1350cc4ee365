The Police Service Commission has prepared a list of 37 operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) implicated in brutality and extra-judicial killings of innocent Nigerian citizens in the course of duty.
Chairman of the Commission, Musiliu Smith, receiving the report of the Presidential Committee on the reform of the Nigeria Police on Friday, revealed that the erring SARS officers listed would be relieved of their jobs. He was, however, silent on whether they will be prosecuted afterwards.
The report was presented by the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Tony Ojukwu.
Meanwhile, the #ENDSARS protests n continue across the country. The youth in northern Nigeria are even modifying the protest to #endinsecuritynow.
