Leaders from the Southeast are already compiling a list of possible candidates with a view to presenting a consensus candidate at the 2023 presidential general election in the country.
A former governor of old Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeke Ezeife, disclosed this on Sunday during a news conference in Abuja, noting that the region is reaching out to other regions in the country on the need for the emergence of consensus candidate from the region for the country’s president comes 2023.
He also dismissed insinuation about lack of unity among people of the South East, saying the Igbos are the most united among the ethnic groups in the country.
The ex-governor said: “We are prominent people, individualistic and not under the command of any traditional ruler, but we are more united than any other ethnic group in Nigeria.
“We have been out of central power for decades, not being president or vice president. But if something is required, we can easily come together as one to speak.”
Ezeife said he was happy that the issue of Igbo presidency was being raised.
He added: “We don’t want ‘sellable’ people, we don’t want people who can sell their country for money, and we don’t want people who are too selfish to help others.
“If you mention some names, they are not Igbo enough and are not acceptable to us because we know they will sell out. So we will bring somebody who will show love to all, show love to Hausa, Yoruba and to his Igbo brothers and to all Nigerians.
“It is too early to mention names, but we are projecting some people already.”
