A South African woman has taken to Facebook to celebrate living with HIV for 22 years.

Mancobeni Makhwayi who shared her story on the social media platform, is a single mother of three boys and also a rape survivor.

She also affirmed that she believes that God has played a big part in her life. Makhwayi wrote;

“I’ve seen the hand of God in my life…

Upon her post, a commenter made this post, “the rate of sexual recklessness in africa is among the root courses of our problems. Thousands of orphans in our orphanages due to our carelessness especially the women. A single mother of three , and I believe from different fathers is now claiming a rape victim just to attract empathy . I don’t support rape in any way but most women should stop seeing the result of their carelessness as rape.”


Another commenter said, “HIV is merely lack of proper food. Please ignore the hoax of the western world. Just like Coronavirus is not as deadly as typhoid or Malaria. Oynbo or Muzungu gave us HIV and are creating the same scare around Coronavirus to restrict movement.”
