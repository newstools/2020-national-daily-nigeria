Despite the last order the Lagos CP Hakeem Odumosu gave the police to crack down on rallies against Nigeria on October 1, scores of protesters under the aegis of Revolution Now trooped out in the street of Lagos to protest against bad governance.
As Nigeria marks its 60th Independence, protesters numbering about two hundred, (200), Thursday stormed the streets of Lagos, demanding the end to bad governance and leadership in the country.
Members of the group are also out in the street of Osogbo, Osun, protesting.
The movement’s founder, Omoyele Sowore, started the protest movement in August 2019, and was arrested and charged with treason. The Sahara Reporters publisher was later released on stringent bail condition, which include restriction from addressing of more than 10 people.
According to Odumosu, any rally today is a rally against Nigeria’s sovereignty, and the police will clamp down on anybody or group protesting on Nigeria’s 60th Independence anniversary.
