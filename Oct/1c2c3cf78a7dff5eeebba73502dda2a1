The wife of His Royal Majesty, Oba Kayode Afolabi of Apomu town in Osun State, Olori Janet Afolabi has taken her passion to ensure women freedom from the shackles of poverty, a notch higher as she unveils a cooperative body known as ‘ Apomu Women Cooperative’.


The Women Cooperative was launched on Friday 2nd October, 2020 in Apomu to support market Women with interest-free loans.
In her speech at the launching, the First Lady of Osun State, Mrs Kafayat Oyetola, said that the importance of Women Cooperative at this period could not be over-emphasized, and called on other communities in the state to emulate the idea for economic development.
Oyetola added, “I am very delighted to have attended the unveiling of the Apomu Women Cooperative. The importance of Women Cooperative at this period cannot be over emphasized.


“I have no doubt that it would help to lift many women and homes out of poverty and enhance the standard of living in the homes.
“I call on other communities in the State which may not have this type of economic development mechanism to emulate the Apomu Women by floating their own cooperative bodies.
“I appreciate Olori Janet Afolabi for her efforts at ensuring the take-off of this project, I also salute the supportive role Your Majesty Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi, the Alapomu of Apomu has played to make this program a success and I have no doubt that the Apomu-In-Council will ensure that the Women Cooperative operates well and meet the development goals for which it was set up.”
