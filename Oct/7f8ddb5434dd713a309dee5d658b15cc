The Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, may have commenced the reform process in the Nigeria Police. The IG on Thursday ordered all Police Officers across the country to eschew from the use of force on peaceful protesters. The IGP notes that citizens have fundamental rights of freedom of expression, assembly and movement which must always be upheld and protected by the police.
Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, DCP Frank Mba, in a statement on Thursday, indicated that the IGP, however, appealed to protesters to continually conduct themselves peacefully and guide their ranks against infiltration by criminal elements.
Mba added that the IGP stressed that the Force leadership has clearly heard the voice of the people and is irrevocably committed to doing everything within its powers to address the observed ills, punish any offending officers and promote a people-friendly police force.
