The northern governors led by GovernorSimon Lalong of Plateau State, Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, rushed to Abuja on Thursday for a meeting with President Buhari at the State House, Abuja, to demand the president to restore  SARS.
Governor Lalong in media interaction with State House Correspondents, emphasized that SARS was not only comprised of bad elements and was useful to fighting bandits in the north. According to Governor Lalong, “SARS is not made up of bad elements alone as it also includes personnel who are doing their work diligently.” The governor maintained that SARS and other units of the Nigeria Police only require reformation to enable it to perform its duties effectively.
