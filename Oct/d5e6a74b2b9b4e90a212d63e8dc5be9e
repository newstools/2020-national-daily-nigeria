#EndSARS protesters on Tuesday blocked the Lagos-Ibadan expressway from the Lagos axis as youths continue to agitate against Police brutality and extra-judicial killings, as well as the reform of the Nigeria Police. The enraged youths blocked the road, obstructing free movement of vehicles from either side of the road.
Apparently, vehicles coming into Lagos from other parts of the country as well as those departing Lagos have to ply with caution.
Several of the youths are displaying placards expressing their demands on the Nigerian government. The activities of the youths have caused traffic gridlock on the federal highway.
