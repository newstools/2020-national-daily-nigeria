Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State may have devised fresh plots to crush Deputy Governor Ajayi Agboola who resigned from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest the October 10 governorship election in the State on the platform of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). The victory of the governor at the polls may have reinforced his confidence to force the exit of the deputy governor from the state government.
The Ondo governor may be penetrating the State House of Assembly to hack the loyalists of the deputy governor in the legislature. There are indicators that this may not be unconnected with the expulsion of a member of the State House of Assembly, Mrs. Favour Tomowewo, on allegation of anti-party activities during the Ondo State governorship.
Mrs. Favour Tomowewo
Tomowewo was identified to be part of the nine members who opposed the impeachment notice of Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi before the elections.
The suspension of the female lawmaker was communicated through a letter dated October 12, 2020, signed by Olagoke Ajimuda, Chairman, and Omosule Taid, Secretary of Mahin Ward 4, Ilaje Constituency 2, Ilaje Local Government Area, Ondo State.
Governor Akeredolu had mocked Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi that if he still has any honour, he should resign from office.
Akeredolu after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja,Â even if Deputy Governor Ajayi refuses to resign, his days are numbered since a new deputy would soon be inaugurated.
Akeredolu during the visit, presented the certificate of return issued by the INEC to President Buhari.
The impeachment of Deputy Governor Ajayi was stalled by the strong support he had from loyalists in the state government. Even after the House had requested the Chief Judge of Ondo State to appoint a judicial panel of inquiry, that was rejected, and the matter was halted there.
