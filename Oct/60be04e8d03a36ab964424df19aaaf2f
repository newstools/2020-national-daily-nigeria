Although the US is making effort to scuttle Nigeria’s nominee Ngozi Okonjo Iweala election as director-general of the Orld Trade Organisation, the federal government has promised not to abandon its own.
In a statement signed by the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ferdinand Nwonye, the ministry said, “Nigeria will continue to engage relevant stakeholders to ensure that the lofty aspiration of her candidate to lead the World Trade Organisation is realized.”
The ministry noted that a meeting of the General Council of the WTO has been scheduled for November 9, 2020, for the final decision on the election process.
Ie explained Okonjo-Iweala has secured the support of the majority of the member countries but is yet to be declared and returned the winner.
“This is because apart from winning the election, all the 164 Member States of WTO were expected to adopt the winner by consensus, in accordance with the rule of procedure of the WTO.
“It is important to highlight that Dr Okonjo-Iweala has secured cross-regional backing with only the United States opposing the consensus.”
The federal government didn’t state the manner of engagement it’s embarking on, though.
The candidate and her government are hopeful it will favour them.
If appointed, she will be the first  female and African to lead the WTO.
