The Operation Crocodile Smile may have swung in to decisive action in Lagos State after Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced the imposition of 24-hour curfew in the state after hoodlums infiltrated the #EndSARS protests burning police stations in the Apapa axis of the state from Orile Iganmu to Ajegunle. At about noon on Tuesday, gun shots were said to heard at Apapa, Tin Can Island and the environs in that part of Lagos State.
Also, the Operation Crocodile Smile was said to have moved to Ikeja, taking over the Ikeja Airport Hotel in the heart of the state capital, where the peaceful #EndSARS protesters had gathered in the early hours of the day.
In Kano State, youths were gathered to have moved very near to the Air Force base in the state capital, Kano, sustaining their protest of police brutality. The Kano youths were said to have removed the veil their political elite had covered their eyes with beguiling them into agitating against the disbandment of SARS after a 17-year old boy was tortured to death  by the police in Kano. The youths on Monday went wild in their protests and have sustained the struggle into Tuesday despite the “Operation Crocodile Smile” of the Nigerian Army which commenced on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, it is anticipated that the peaceful #EndSARS protesters may have to retreat since the 24-hour curfew ends on Wednesday noon while the Edo State 24-curfew ends on Tuesday evening. They may have no need for confrontation with security operatives.
