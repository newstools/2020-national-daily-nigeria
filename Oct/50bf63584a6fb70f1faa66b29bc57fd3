Lagos State Government has suspended all government activities and declared lockdown for 72 hours due to growing violence in the state.
This was disclosed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in a live broadcast on Wednesday.
Some hours ago, eyewitnesses claimed armed uniformed men opened fire on #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki tollgate area of the state on Tuesday evening.
Sanwo- Olu said, “Fellow Lagosians, in the sensitive mood and in the mood of the nation at this time, I have directed further that we have an immediate suspension of all state activities for the next three days, except those that are connected to the security activities in the state and the management of the current issues.
“I have also directed that at all public buildings within our reach, that we lower the flag for the next three days as a mark of respect and solidarity for the protests.
Recall that the governor had on Tuesday declared a 24-hour curfew in the state due to the raging #EndSARS protests and demonstrations in the state, which has been hijacked by criminals and hoodlums with attacks on innocent citizens and the destruction of properties.
