Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, on Wednesday decried the military onslaught of #EndSARS peaceful protesters at Lekki toll gate, Lagos, on Tuesday night. The Speaker described the onslaught as disturbing and not reflective of the country’s growing democracy.
The Speaker expressed grief over reports of the mass killings as well as the civil disturbances that trailed the killings in Lagos. He appealed for calm and demanded thorough investigations into the onslaught of peaceful protesting Nigerian youths.
in a statement declared: “the events in my home state, Lagos, last night, and uptill this afternoon have left my heart heavy and my spirit disturbed.
“After 60 years, our democracy should have grown beyond the point where conflicting vision of nationhood results in violence on the streets and blood on the ground.
“It is unavoidably and painfully clear that there were a number of casualties as a result of gunfire at the Lekki toll gate.
“Therefore, there needs to be quick and thorough investigations to determine the facts of what happened last night in Lagos. Our nation urgently needs and the Nigerian people deserve an accounting of the acts that led to the events of last night.”
