Barely days after the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye called for restructuring of the country as a means of keeping it together, the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has also emphasized the need to restructure the country.
The National President of the group, Yerima Shettima who disclosed this Tuesday, warned that Nigeria was at the verge of collapse, if it’s not restructured.
“For us to move and make a meaningful impact, we need to restructure this country, power must be devolved to the regions. Let there be division of labour where it’s not everything the centre decides.
“If we allow the centre to continue the way we are going, one day, the centre will just collapse. It’s very clear, everybody knows that the centre can’t hold, and we need to look at it thoroughly and ensure it’s reviewed with the hope of decentralizing the central government so that things will be done right.
“This American style of government does not favour us, even there, they don’t practice this style of governance. A clear example is what happened between Trump and the governor of New York during the pandemic, so to some extent, the state governors should have their autonomy and do things their way, but in Nigeria, you dear not challenge the almighty centre, if it comes to the issue of policies.
