Exactly 10 days after the Lekki Toll Gate shooting local and international media have described as a massacre, the Doris Okwuobi Judicial Panel the Lagos government set up made an unscheduled visit to a military hospital at Ikoyi.
A member of the panel said they went after Friday sitting on a tip-off of suspicious activities going on in the morgue.
SAN Ebun Adegboruwa, who is on the panel, said, “We decided to pay an unscheduled visit to the mortuary of the military hospital because we have confidential information concerning certain events that took place in the hospital here.
“We are waiting for them to grant us access to inspect the mortuary because we have reasons to believe that that facility is relevant to our investigation.
“We don’t want to make any conclusions yet until we have access to the mortuary to inspect it. We have a pathologist with us, who is here to help us conduct medical examination of bodies that we may find in the mortuary,” Mr Adegboruwa said.
The military officers in the hospital resisted the panel’s entrance initially, but they later allowed the visitors in to the morgue of the hospital.
The facility, which is still under renovation and non-functional, is controlled by the 65 Battalion that deployed soldiers that allegedly shot at protesters at the toll gate.
According to Amnesty International, the soldiers took away the corpses of dead protesters. That might be part of the reason the panel, after stopping over at the toll agte where they picked six spent bullets, decided to visit the morgue with a pathologist.
Colonel Ogoh and A. I Taiwo, the military officers who led the team on the tour around the hospital, said it has been on renovation since October 2019.
