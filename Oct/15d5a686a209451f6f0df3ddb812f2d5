Officers of the Nigeria Police have been off the streets of Lagos and Abuja two days after the Inspector General of Police the Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, ordered the immediate mobilization of all police operational assets and resources to reclaim the public space and bring an end to the violence, killings, looting and wanton destruction of public and private property, by criminal elements masquerading as protesters in some parts of the country. The IGP gave the order to all Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs), Commissioners of Police (CPs), Heads of Police Operational Units, Squadron and Base Commanders in charge of Zonal/State/FCT Commands, the Police Mobile Force, Counter Terrorism Unit and the Special Protection Unit, today 24th October, 2020. In addition, CPs/Heads of Police Formations in the various states were also charged to mobilize their men and work in sync with the Command CPs in the areas where they are domiciled, to dominate the public space and ensure peace and safety in the affected areas.
The IGP, while noting that enough is enough to all acts of lawlessness, disruption of public peace and order and wanton violence which have resulted to indiscriminate looting of shops, malls and warehouses, damage to property and loss of lives in some parts of the country, further directed the Police strategic managers to personally lead and coordinate the operation and use all legitimate means, to halt further slide into lawlessness and brigandage.
The IGP enjoined law-abiding citizens not to panic but rather join forces with the police and other members of the law enforcement community to protect their communities from the criminal elements.
He further called for the understanding and cooperation of the citizens, assuring that the action is geared towards ensuring public order and safety and public security in our communities.
The IGP however warned troublemakers not to test the collective will of the nation by coming out to cause any further breakdown of law and order.
The presence of the police, army, and other security operatives, including the LASTMA has not been noticed on major roads and urban streets in Lagos since the Monday Lekki toll gate shooting of unarmed #EndSARS peaceful protesters by the military. Commercial vehicle drivers have been having field days of lawlessness, driving against traffic with impunity.
