Corps Assistant Illiya Ibrahim of the Gwagwalad Divion of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has been sacked for joining hoodlums looting CaCovid palliatives in Abuja.
Ekunola Gbenga, the media assistant to the Commandant General NSCDC, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu, said Ibrahim’s dismissal was approved after a series of investigations and deliberations by the junior disciplinary committee.
”The recommendation was given after the officer was charged under the public service rule which is related to unbecoming conduct of officers,” Gbenga said in a press statement.
“This disciplinary measure was taken after a series of investigations and deliberations by the junior disciplinary committee and recommendations were made to the management,” it said.
CG Muhammadu , however, appreciated officers and men of the Corps, including members of the public for providing useful information that has continued to assist the Corps in identifying unfit individuals within the ranks for appropriate action.
