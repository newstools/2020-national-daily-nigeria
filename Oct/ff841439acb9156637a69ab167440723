The Ghana international revealed his health status on Sunday evening, October 18, after missing Crystal Palace’s 1-1 draw against Brighton and Hove Albion at Selhurst Park and says he has gone into self-isolation to treat himself.

Ayew recently returned to the club after going on international duty with Ghana in Turkey where he played in their international friendly fixtures against Qatar and Mali after making four appearances in the Premier League for his club this season.

The 29-year-old striker has disclosed he is asymptomatic to Covid-19 but he has commenced the self-isolation at home.

“Sadly, I have tested positive for Covid-19 and have begun my quarantine in line with the health guidance,” Ayew tweeted.

“Thankfully, I am feeling fine and I do not have any symptoms. I will be cheering the boys on from home and look forward to being back on the pitch soon.”
