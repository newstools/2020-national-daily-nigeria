The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, on Sunday expressed concern over the incessant cases of extrajudicial killings, harassment, illegal arrest, and extortion of defenseless citizens by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in different parts of the country. The DSP, therefore, condemned the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for the atrocities committed in several parts of Nigeria.
The Deputy President of the Senate decried the shooting of a man by operatives of SARS in his constituency in Ughelli, Delta State, over the victim’s refusal to allow the operatives to search his phone as well as another shooting of a youth in the town by men of the ‘Operation Delta Safe’ over the victim’s refusal to allow the operatives to search his phone. Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege emphasized the need for comprehensive reforms and overhaul of security units in the country.
Senator Omo-Agege called on the authorities of the Nigeria Police to fish out the culprits for prosecution, noting that “this will serve as a deterrent to others.”
Omo-Agege appealed to youths in his constituency area to exercise utmost restraint, assuring that investigation is ongoing. He counseled the security personnel to always maintain the rules of engagement in performance of their duties.
Omo-Agege declared: “Those who are authorised to bear arms and maintain law and order in the country ought to understand that such must be exercised with responsibility especially when human life is sacrosanct.
“I hope those who are quick at pulling the trigger would adopt strategies that would foster mutual understanding between them and those they are tasked to protect, in their bid to save the lives of Nigerians. It would be a depressing twist of fate for them to be listed among those contributing to the list of the dead in this challenging period globally.”
