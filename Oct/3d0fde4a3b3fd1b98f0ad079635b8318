Joe Biden, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party in the Untied States has shot himself into controversial public glare. His statement on some beautiful ladies that “he wants to see them dancing when they’re four years older”, has been generating ripples in the US.
It was gathered that Biden’s remarks on a group of “beautiful young ladies” when having campaign stopover in Miami, have gone viral.
Taking his campaign tour to the Little Haiti Cultural Center, on Monday, Biden was said to have told the crowd: “the good news is, for me, I’m here. The bad news for you is I’m coming back.”
Sighting a group of girls, he said:  “And I want to see these beautiful young ladies – I want to see them dancing when they’re four years older too.”
When asked for interpretation, the Biden campaign explained that Article II of the U.S. Constitution provided: “He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years.”
It was gathered that another remark from Biden resurfaced which trended on social media this week. It was noted a September 15 campaign clip portray Biden explaining why people are able to quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.
“They’re saying, ‘Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some Black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf,'” Biden said.
