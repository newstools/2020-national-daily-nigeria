As the ENDSARS protest escalates across the southwest, the Oyo state seems the next most agitated in the regions as a police station got torched in the Ojoo area of Ibadan in the afternoon on October 20.
While there are reports five people died while some youth attacked the station, but the government has yet to confirm it.
According to Gov.Seyi Makinde, problem started two days ago when protesters he called hoodlums infiltrated the ENDSARS protest, mounting rod block in front of police stations and on the Ojo road.
The stateâ€™s Police Public Relations Officer Olugbenga Fadeyi has yet to speak officially on the matter.
But Makinde said he has dispatched the state joint security outfit Operation Bust to sort out the hoodlums from the genuine protesters who he said have rights to protest.
