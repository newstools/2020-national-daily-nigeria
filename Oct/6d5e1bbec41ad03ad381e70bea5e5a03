The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari over the violent crackdown on unarmed protesters in the country with many lives already lost.
The Archbishop, who is the Chief of the Anglican Church globally disclosed this while reacting to videos of protesters getting shot at the Lekki tollgate by security operatives on Tuesday.
In a series of tweets on Wednesday,  the Anglican leader said he condemns the shooting of unarmed protesters in Lekki, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that lives are protected.
He expressed sadness over the development in Nigeria,  advising for a peaceful dialogue in settling the matter to avoid another major crisis in the region.
“I have urged President @MBuhari directly to ensure that lives are protected – and I say that again now. I mourn for Nigeria. May God save Nigeria,” he said.
“I condemn in the strongest terms the reported deliberate shooting of unarmed protesters in Lagos and other parts of Nigeria.
Recall that several social media accounts revealed peaceful protesters were being shot at by the military at the Lekki toll gate holdout for the #EndSars protest.
The Nigerian Army, has however denied deploying soldiers to attack #EndSARS protesters who assembled at the Lekki Toll Plaza.
