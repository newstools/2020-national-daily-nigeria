The Governor of Oyo state, Seyi Makinde, has advised former governor of Ekiti state, Ayo Fayose to look far away from Oyo state in search of his enemies.
Makinde said this while reacting to the allegation by Fayose that hoodlums working for the governor and a former national vice chairman of the party of the PDP, Olabode George removed his cap as he made his way to the podium at the grand finale of the Ondo governorship campaign.
The former Governor accused Makinde and former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Bode George of masterminding the assault.
But reacting through his Chief Press Secretary Taiwo Adisa, Makinde said he wouldn’t want to join issues with Fayose, who he said appears perpetually desirous of hugging the limelight even when the occasion doesn’t desire such grandstanding.
“Governor Makinde has no link whatsoever with the incident Fayose’s aide was talking about.
“We expect all right- thinking members of the PDP to join the Governor of Oyo State in the prosecution of the noble and democratic assignment he is executing on behalf of the PDP in Ondo State at this time, instead of seeking to distract him one way or the other.
“The governor will, however, not be distracted either on the task at hand or on the well- intentioned desire to join other leaders to rebuild the PDP in the South West geopolitical zone.”
