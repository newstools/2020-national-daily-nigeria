More facts are beginning to emerge on the complete list of affected police officers that have been recommended for demotion or outright dismissal from the force for various human rights abuses.
According to investigations, contrary to some reports that a former Head of the Police Public Complaint Rapid Response Unit, Assistance Commissioner of Police, Abayomi Shogunle, has been dismissed, it was gathered that he was actually recommended for demotion to Chief Superintendent of Police.
Similarly, a former Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State Command, Dolapo Badmus, was also demoted.
The development is coming at a time Nigerian youths are demanding #EndSARS as well as police brutality.
