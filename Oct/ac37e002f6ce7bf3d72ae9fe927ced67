Actor Yul Edochie has asked what Nigerians are celebrating as the country marks 60th independence day anniversary.

According to him, the truth is that Nigerians are suffering and have no cause to celebrate. Listing some of the problems plaguing the country at the moment, the actor tweeted

”I cannot wish anyone a happy independence when my people are not happy. What are we celebrating? Fuel price increase? Electricity tariff hike? Hardship? Bad roads? Killings everywhere? Jobless youths turned beggars? The list is endless. Speak the truth. Nigerians are suffering.”
