The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership, CACOL, has dissociated the members of its Osun State Chapter of Good Governance, Accountability and Transparency Education (CGATE) from the recent #EndSARS protests that turned violent in the state.
In a release issued by the anti-corruption boss, Mr. Debo Adeniran through the organization’s Director of Administration and Programmes, Mr. Tola Oresanwo, he noted that over the past few days, there have been renewed calls for the scrapping of the special anti-robbery squad (SARS) of the Nigeria police force over reports of brutality and extrajudicial killings.
However, despite the fact that the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu had since disbanded the SARS unit, the protests have continued, with activists issuing a five-point demand which include release of all persons arrested and justice for victims of police brutality.
“Though the government of the day has acceded to these demands but the protesters are still on the streets while some of them have taken the protests too far by turning it to violence, unruly behaviours and wanton destruction of properties.
“In as much as we believe that the Nigeria Police in its entirety needs total reform in order to improve on its service delivery and to bring their operations at par with international best practices, we do not subscribe to the use of violence and any act of brigandage”.
“To this end, we want to state unequivocally that members of our Good Governance, Accountability and Transparency Education (CGATE) Osun State Chapter are peace-loving, law-abiding, courteous and good mannered people, hence they cannot and will not involve themselves in any acts that would jettison the peaceful coexistence of the residents of Osun State”.
