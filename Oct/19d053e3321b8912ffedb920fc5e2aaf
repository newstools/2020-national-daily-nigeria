The traditional princes and Princesses in Lagos under the aegis of Forum of Eko Princes and Princesses has called on the Lagos state government to investigate Wednesday’s attack on the Palace of Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Babatunde Osuolale Aremu Akiolu by hoodlums.
It would be recalled that the hoodlums broke into the palace situated at Lagos Island despite the presence of soldiers, vandalized the palace and also seized his staff of office.
The staff of office is the symbol of authority of the monarch.
In a statement signed by Prince Adewale Taorid Ojora on behalf of the forum, condemned in very strong terms the attack, desecration and vandalisation of IGA IDUNGANRAN the Palace of the Oba of Lagos by hoodlums and criminal elements masquerading as aggrieved “ENDSARS” protesters.
He said the ancient Palace which is the official residence of the OBA of LAGOS was originally built in 1670 and has remained an historical monument and a cultural rallying point for Lagosians.
“Reviewing the damning footage of the violent invasion by these miscreants and vandals, it is disheartening to observe the wanton desecration of our traditional heritage in Lagos.
“We totally condemn this attack and demand that it cease immediately and urge the security services to secure the Palace. “We commiserate with our Royal father Alaiyeluwa Oba Rilwan Babatunde Osuolale Aremu Akiolu, Akiolu I and call on the Lagos State Government to investigate this incident and bring the perpetrators of this dastardly act to book,” he said.
