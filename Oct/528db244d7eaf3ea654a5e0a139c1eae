Following attacks on some government facilities and innocent citizens by suspected hoodlums, the Edo state government on Monday imposed a 24-hour curfew across the state till further notice.
In a statement issued by Secretary to the state government, Osarodion Ogie Esq on Monday, the curfew is to take effect from 4pm, October 19, 2020.
It would be recalled that hoodlums taking advantage of the #EndSARS protests had attacked the Benin Prison, and allegedly freed some of the inmates, while the  High Court 4 which is beside the prison was also vandalised by the invaders.
In the statement, Ogie said the decision has become necessary because of the very disturbing incidents of vandalism and attacks on private individuals and institutions by hoodlums in the guise of #ENDSARS protesters.
“While the government of Edo State respects the rights of its citizens to undertake legitimate protests, it cannot sit idly when hoodlums have taken laws into their hands to cause mayhem on innocent citizens and the state.
“By the directive, schools and businesses are to shut down activities accordingly. Those who cannot move safely are to stay put between now and 4pm till calmness is restored.
“Parents are advised to rein in their children, youths and wards, to forestall further breakdown of law and order.
“The responsibility of government is to protect lives and property and maintain law and order, therefore, anyone found outside in violation of the curfew would be dealt with according to the law,” he added.
The #EndSARS protests which entered its 13th day on Monday spanned Lagos, Abuja, Awka, Warri, Abeokuta and other parts of Nigeria where it had persisted.
