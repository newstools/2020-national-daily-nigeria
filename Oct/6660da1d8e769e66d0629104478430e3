The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, may be facing fresh trouble in the investigation of corruption allegations against by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC, it was gathered, traced about 40 duplexes to the Lagos State Speaker. The duplexes were identified to be located opposite the Lagos State Polytechnic, Ikorodu.
The commission further discovered  about 57 landed properties in different parts of Agege, an outskirt of Ikeja, linked to the Speaker.
The EFCC was gathered to have disclosed that its investigations revealed that all the houses – in Ikorodu and Agege – were acquired via a proxy, who the commission identified as Kazeem.
“We have investigated and we have been able to identify all those properties, the ones in Agege and Ikorodu, we have pictures of all of them.
The commission was cited to have stated: “Also, Kazeem, the man who bought all the houses on Speaker’s behalf, has confessed that the Speaker owns all the House and we have the records of all the transfers made to him by the Speaker.
“We are also aware that the Speaker sent some money in cash to Kazeem through Baruwa, his Personal Assistant, to pay off some of the owners of those properties.”
The EFCC was said to have further disclosed that Obasa was to report to its office for interrogation on the discovered properties linked to him but suddenly said he is ill.
“We couldn’t do anything because he felt ill and we had to let him go and treat himself so that he could return on Monday. We are expecting him tomorrow to come and explain how he was able to buy those number of houses,” the commission was cited to have said.
