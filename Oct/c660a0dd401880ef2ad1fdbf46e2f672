The chairman of the presidential panel on SARS reforms has led his committee to submit the panel report and recommendations on former operatives of the squad indicted in right violations allegations.
Tony Ojukwu, who is the executive director of the Nigeria Human Rights Commission, presented the document to Justice Minister Abubakar Malami on October 19.
The three-man panel recommended the 35 indicted officers, from 12 states and Abuja, for dismissal and prosecution.
Ojukwu said the officers were found culpable of offences that ranged from alleged extra-judicial killings, unlawful arrest and detention, threat and intimidation, unfounded allegations, seizure of properties, as well as illegal blockage of bank accounts of innocent citizens.
The #ENDSARS protesters have made a 5-point demand on the President Muhammadu Buhari governmentâ€”demands meant to end SARS, prosecute its bad officers, investigate rights violation, punish the convicted, compensate victims, and improve police welfare.
