President Donald Trump of the United States on Monday departed the military hospital where he was being treated for COVID-19 and returned to the White House. Trump arrived at the White House aboard a helicopter and was welcomed by a joyful crowd of supporters celebrating his arrival with shouts of “Trump, Trump, Trump.”
National Daily gathered that most supporters arrived at the White House early and waited all day long for his arrival. Expecting his movement in  armoured limo, the supporters were taken by surprise when Trump flew off on board Marine One, hovering over the crowd gathered in front of Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, outside Washington, DC, and moved to the White House.
The change of transportation mode was said to be a security decision.
“I’m not disappointed based on the security,” Jasmine Rochon was cited to have said. She had driven 120 miles on Monday from Philadelphia. “But the fact that he flew in and made sure that he turned and waved at us, that’s good enough for me,” she had added.
