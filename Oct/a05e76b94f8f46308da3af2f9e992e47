Despite appeals by President Muhammadu to Nigerian youth protesting police brutality, the nationwide angst appears to wax stronger by the day.
Youths on Saturday continued the #EndSARS protests in the Ikorodu and Lekki areas of Lagos.
The protesters chanted “EndSARS” as they marched peacefully through the streets.
The protest led by #Revolution Now, BBOG, and Concerned Nigerians took place in Abuja, Lagos, Osun, Oyo, and Delta.
There, however, pockets of violence in Osun and Delta where a police man was shot dead.
On Friday, President Buhari directed IGP Mohammed Adamu to make quick reform in the Nigerian police force, in addition to the quick fixes, including ban from patrol and other routine ops.
