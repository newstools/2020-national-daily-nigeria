Coordinator of Defense Media Operations, John Enenche revealed that a cache of arms and ammunition were also recovered during the search and rescue/clearance operation carried out in conjunction with local vigilantes supported by close air support on the location.

An unconfirmed number of bandits escaped with gunshot wounds during the encounter with gallant troops.

Eneche said;

“In the same vein, following credible intelligence on the criminal elements who escaped from the onslaught earlier, troops apprehended three of the criminal elements in Kujeni village.

“Currently the gallant troops have dominated the area with aggressive patrols to deny the criminal elements freedom of action.

“The Military High Command commends the gallant troops for their dexterity and encourages them to intensify the onslaught against the enemies of our country.

“The general public is thus encouraged to continue providing credible information to the troops operating within their localities.”
