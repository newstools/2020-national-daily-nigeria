Nigerian multi-talented disc jockey, singer, and rapper Obianuju Catherine Udeh, popularly known as DJ Switch, has alleged that about 15 people died after soldiers opened fire on unarmed protesters at Lekki Toll Gate on Tuesday, 20 October 2020.
The songwriter who went live during the shooting of #EndSARS protesters further said the dead bodies were taken away by the soldiers.
The Nigerian Army had denied any involvement in the shooting, even stating that videos showing their officers actively shooting at the protesters was photoshopped.
However, DJ Switch in a new video gave a detailed account of how soldiers stormed the venue accompanied by SARS officials.
She also revealed bullets picked at the scene, pointing out particularly to one that would’ve hit her and another removed from someone’s thigh.
“My life was being threatened for speaking up but I just want to clear a few things that I’ve been seeing online. To our leaders, I urge you please do not minimize the suffering of families.
“Do not insult the grief of Nigerians, do not insult the intelligence of Nigerians. Do not insult the pain that families are facing. People were falling left and right.
“Yes, there were soldiers there. Another part that people are not really talking about. The police also came, the SARS people we’re talking about also came minutes after the soldiers left. They were tear-gassing. It’s like Cotonou pepper. Our coconut head generation. They will run and they will come back.
“They switched off the lights and it was pitch black. While the soldiers were running around and picking their shells, we were running around and picking their shelves too. The police and SARS were also there, aiming and shooting. Who takes life bullets to a protest? Who does that?”
“There is something we also did that I feel we should not have done, we carried dead bodies and dumped them at the feet of soldiers so that they could see what they had done.
