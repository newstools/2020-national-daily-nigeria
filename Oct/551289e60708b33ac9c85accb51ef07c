The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has joined the #EndSARS protests of the Nigerian youths across the country. The Speaker vowed that he will not sign the 2021 budget of the federal government if there is no provision for the compensation of victims of police brutality and extra-judicial killings by the Nigerian Police, as well as #EndSARS protesters who fell victims of security operatives violence during the protest.
The Speaker agitated that the Nigeria Police are not above the laws of Nigeria, insisting they must be accountable to Nigerian citizens.
“We will establish a system of citizen-led accountability for the Nigerian Police Force because in a democracy we have set out to build, the police are not above the citizenry.
“They are servants of the people. The police are not above the law, they are its guardians. As we endeavour to hold our nation’s police to higher standards of professional conducts, we must also make sure we provide for the welfare of the men and women in uniform,” Gbajabiamila had declared at plenary on Monday.
