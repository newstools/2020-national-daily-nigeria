After Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike ordered the police to head off any ENDSARS protest in the state, following the federal government proscription of the police squad SARS, hundreds of youth, mostly entertainers still went ahead protesting, in defiance of the governorâ€™s order.
Ragged out in black t-shirts and Jeans, the protesters gathered at the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park as early as 8 am despite truckloads of police men dispatched in strategic point across Port Harcourt on Tuesday.
The youth condemned the recent SARS killings of colleagues in Port Harcourt, especially a musician popularly known as Sleek.
The protesters have marched to the Police headquarters at Moscow Road.
The nationwide protest began last Thursday, four days after a video supposedly showing police brutality in Ughelli, Delta, trended online.
