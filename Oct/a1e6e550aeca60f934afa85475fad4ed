For three days at a go, Nigeria has yet to record a covid 19related death, but the federal lawmakers that will be receiving President Muhammadu Buhari for budget presentation are not taking chances.
The upper house said on Wednesday that only those involved in budget preparation would accompany Buhari into the complex for the 2021 budget presentation on October 8.
Senate President Ahmed Lawan told his colleagues at plenary that the joint session would take place in the chamber of the House of Representatives.
“This time around because of the situation of COVID-19 pandemic, we have made arrangements to observe social distancing in the chamber.
“We also have to wear or face masks mandatorily. We are going to also abridge the entire event because we will be many there.
“So the entire event will last just about an hour. From the entry of the President into the chamber and addresses and the presentation and laying will be just an hour event.
“This is done so that we would be able to comply with the requirements of the COvID-19 protocol.
“Mr. President this time around will not be accompanied by many people on the entourage.
“Only a few people – very key and relevant to the budget – will accompany Mr. President into the chamber.
” I think by the arrangement those of them that have little to do with the budget will join virtually what will happen,” Lawan said.
