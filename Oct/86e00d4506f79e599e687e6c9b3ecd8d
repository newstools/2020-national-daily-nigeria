Governor Babajide Sanwo–Olu of Lagos State on Tuesday imposed 24-hour curfew in the state.
Governor Sanwo-Olu made the urgent broadcast via his official Twitter handle as hoodlums hijacked the peaceful #EndSARS protests in the state, setting various police stations on fire.
Sanwo-Olu in a brief statement declared: “I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the well-being of our society. Lives and limbs have been lost as criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem on our state.
“As a government that is alive to its responsibility and has shown a commitment to the movement #ENDSARS, we will not watch and allow anarchy in our dear state.
“I, therefore, hereby impose a 24-hour curfew on all parts of the State as from 4:00 pm today, 20th October 2020. Nobody, except essential service providers and first responders, must be found on the streets.”
The proclamation is widely circulated on the governor’s page in all social media platforms.
