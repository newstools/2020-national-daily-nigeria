Edoâ€™s House Speaker Francis Okiye has been impeached, and a new one elected in his place.
Majority Leader Okhurobo made the motion following allegations of high-handedness against Okiye.
Nine out of 10 lawmakers present in the House signed the impeachment petition on Monday.
The latest development among the honorable loyal to Gov. Godwin Obaseki has made that faction of the state legislature more fractious.
There are 17 others loyal to the APC former national chairman Adams Oshiomhole, 14 of them yet to be inaugurated, though.
The House immediately swore in Marcus Onobun, representing Esan West State Constituency, as the new Speaker.
