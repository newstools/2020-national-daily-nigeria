Some Israeli doctors have stated that the corona virus lockdown across the world was unnecessary, arguing that the lockdown has caused more harm than good. The doctors pointed out that Israel’s hospitals do not lack the capacity to handle the coronavirus outbreak, adding that the hospitals are not collapsing. They maintained that the lockdown does more harm than good, adding that the policy adopted for tackling COVID is fundamentally wrong. It was gathered that “an increasing number of senior physicians are convinced: Israel needs to switch gears in its handling of the pandemic.”
Dr. Avi Mizrachi, Director, Coronavirus Department, Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh), Tel Aviv, stated: “There are immense gaps between approaches for dealing with the coronavirus, and the truth is not in the middle.”
Questioning the truth, on a scale of 1 to 10; he declared: “My impression is that if 1 is, it’s only flu and 10 is a colossal disaster, we’re between 2 and 3, at most. Ultimately, this is a viral disease, so there is a movement today that objects to its categorization as a pandemic. Our hospital deployed excellently to receive coronavirus patients, and even if their number doubles, they will get optimal treatment. I don’t understand what my colleagues are saying.”
