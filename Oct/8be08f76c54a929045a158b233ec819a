Yul Edochie has said the videos showing Nigerians looting should give any good leader sleepless nights.

The actor said the video shows “Nigerians are dying of hunger” and leaders who watch it should be “working out ways to improve the living standard of the masses.”

However, he said Nigerian leaders aren’t concerned about that, instead they are concerning themselves with social media.

”After watching those looting videos, every good leader should be having sleepless nights working out ways to improve the living standard of the masses. Nigerians are dying of hunger. Rather your headache is social media. SHAME!” he wrote on Twitter
