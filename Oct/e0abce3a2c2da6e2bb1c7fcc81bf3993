General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye has warned that the violent crackdown on unarmed #EndSARS protesters may aggravate the already tensed situation.

Adeboye, in a statement on his verified Facebook page on Wednesday, stated that the condemnable actions of the military risked driving the agitations of the young people underground, thereby making the situation unmanageable.

Adeboye who condemned Tuesday’s shooting of protesters at Lekki tollgate by soldiers, called on the Federal government to immediately investigate the tragic event.

He said he was confounded that prior to the sad events at the Lekki Toll Gate, the Nigerian Police failed to arrest the weapon-bearing hoodlums who were attacking the well-organized and non-violent #EndSARS protesters.


“I call on the Federal Government to thoroughly investigate the tragic events at Lekki and other parts of the country, give justice to all victims even as it engages the #EndSARS protesters to reach a common agreement to end police brutality.

“I am also appealing to the youths to allow peace reign & stop any form of action that would give the Military any other form of excuse to attack. May the peace of God come upon our nation, now more than ever in JESUS name (Amen),” Adeboye said.
