Nigerians protesting against police brutality have shut down all major roads in Lagos state, including the Lagos State Government Secretariat, Alausa, Ikeja, on Monday.
The state was thrown into heavy gridlock, as many commuters were stranded around in several areas, such as Alausa, Maryland, Ojota, Ketu, Mile 12, Ikeja, Egbeda, Ikotun, Berger, among others.
The Popular Toyin Roundabout as well as Allen roundabout like many other major roads was completely barricaded.
The protesters stormed the secretariat very early, chanting anti-government songs and wielding different placards as they blocked workers from accessing their offices.
The #EndSARS protesters locked all the entrances and motorists, pedestrians were turned back from coming out and going into the premises.
However, security operatives are on standby in case of any break out of violence.
