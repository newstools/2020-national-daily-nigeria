The monthly bill of the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company in Lagos has gone from the outrageous to the absurd. While citizens are still lamenting the undeserved N28,000 and above monthly bill by the company in the month of August, the Ikeja DisCO arbitrarily increased the monthly bill to mover N47,000 in the month of September.
A citizen in the suburb of Ikeja in the month of September was imposed a bill of N25,187.25 on an assumed August consumption of 1,100; some other citizens who interacted with this Reporter lamented that their bills were even above N28,000 in the same month. The same citizen in the month of October was imposed a bill of N47,083.12 on an assumed consumption of 1,025.
This is a resident that electricity supply is not regular. The company share electricity supply among the streets within the area, with some having electricity on particular days while others will be in darkness, waiting for their turn. Even on the days of supply, the supply is not regular neither does it run 24 hours.
Unfortunately, the managers sit in the comfort of their office to ‘forge’ consumption rate in the month. Foer those not using prepaid metres. Where metres are installed, no electricity worker goes to the facilities to read the metres to determine the actual consumption by citizens. Some facilities have no metre installed yet figures are reeled out as consumption rate. How did the managers get those figures they claimed are monthly consumption? Some of these victims reside on a 3-bedroom flat, some 2-bedrrom.
Nigerians not only pay for services not rendered but are losing huge proportion of their monthly wages or salaries on monthly electricity bills, and facing difficulties taking care of their families.
