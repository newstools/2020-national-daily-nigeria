Human Rights Lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has said the #EndSARS protesters are still on the street because they don’t trust the federal government to fully implement their demands.
Falana, whose son, Folarin (Falz) is part of the celebrities leading the protest, disclosed this while speaking on a Channels Television programme on Wednesday night.
He claimed there are no signs that President Muhammadu Buhari administration is ready to respect the rights of Nigerians, and also criticized the federal government for setting up the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team, to replace the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Unit (SARS).
“As far as I’m concerned, so far, we are only scratching the surface of the problem. And there’s been no indication that the government is prepared yet to respect the rights of the Nigerian people embodied in the constitution and other statues.
“For me, it is not actually the name that matters and I think what the youths are saying is that beyond renaming. They want to see concrete steps taken to show that it is not going to be business as usual when it comes to policing in Nigeria,” Falana said.
