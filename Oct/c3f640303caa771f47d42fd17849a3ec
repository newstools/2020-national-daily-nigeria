There are indications that the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, may have flee from Nigeria in the early hours of Wednesday after the Tuesday night bloodshed by the gunmen dressed in the uniform of the Nigerian Army at the Lekki toll gate, Lagos, where many youths protesting police brutality and extra-judicial killings were massacred.
Tinubu was said to have flown out of Nigeria in a private jet. His destination could not be confirmed; while some insinuated that he went to France, others said he ran to the United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army have denied killing unarmed peaceful #EndSARS protesters at Lekki toll gate Lagos.
The so-feared crime against humanity in the wake of the military exercise – “Operation Crocodile Smile” now live with Nigerians. The actual figure of innocent citizens killed in the onslaught is yet to be ascertained but over 68 death were said to have been recorded, with many others injured.
The bloodshed spread to several other parts of the state.
