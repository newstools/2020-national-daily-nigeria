The Shehu Shagari Way in Abuja has been splattered with blood-red paint to symbolize the blood-spilling associated with the Nigerian police SARS unit as protest to end the police unit goes on in Abuja October 8, 2020
Paralysing traffic, the protesters carrying placards with inscription #ENDSARS sat on the road chanting “End SARS.”
The renewed protest was sparked on Sunday after a video the Delta government and police authority called misleading trended as Nigerians on social media saw a young man lying on the road as a another man wrestled an armed cop in a special uniform.
The story of brutality the video relayed angered many, despite clarifications by the state government, te police, and even Festus Keyamo, state minister of labour.
In the torrents of response that followed the video were comments by V.P Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmed Lawan and others asking for some drastic action against SARS.
IGP Mohammed Adamu has since introduced some rapid-fire reforms, including those stopping special units from routine ops like stop and search, patrol, and arrests
