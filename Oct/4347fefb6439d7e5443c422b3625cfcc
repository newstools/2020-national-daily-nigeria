The US President, Donald Trump, candidate of the Republican Party and the opposition, Joe Biden, candidate of the Democrats, on Thursday stormed Florida city of Tampa in advancing their mobilization for populist votes. The rival candidates may be crossing paths for the first time as their campaign time is separated by few hours but on same day for the November presidential election.
It was gathered that Florida is the third largest state in the US. The state has a record of always supporting the winner in all US presidential elections since 1964, except one election. Florida is also dominated by African Americans and has high population of blacks.
President Trump will be guest to large mask-less and densely packed supporters in the afternoon of Thursday while Biden will be hosted in a distanced drive-in meeting in the evening.
Trump was said to have voted in Arizona, and Biden voted in his home state, Delaware. Joe Biden had met with health experts, seeing expert support in reviewing plans to handle the corona virus pandemic. He had reassured voters that he would use science to fight the virus.
Corona virus has killed over 227,000 people in the US and forced millions out of work in the world’s largest economy as a resurgent wave of cases was reaching record levels.
“I’m not running on a false promise of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch.
“But what I can promise you is this: We’ll start on Day 1 by doing the right thing. We’ll let science guide our decisions,” Biden, a former vice president, said.
On Saturday, Biden is to get some star power when he is joined on the stump in Michigan by Barack Obama, whom he served as vice president.
