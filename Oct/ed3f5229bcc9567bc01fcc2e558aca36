A medical doctor, Dr. Simone Gold, has questioned a $1 billion deal on ineffective corona virus drug with the European Union (EU).
Dr. Simone Gold in a tweet @drsimonegold, protested: “Gilead made a $1 billion deal with the EU three weeks ago and a deal with the FDA one week ago, even though studies indicate its drug is NOT effective.”
The doctor expressed disappointment that the inefficacy of the drug as revealed by studies on over 100 persons has been ignored by the authorities. “HCQ + zinc at $15/treatment with 100+ studies showing significant efficacy has been completely ignored. Why,” Dr. Gold declared.
