Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga has finally decided to stay at Stamford Bridge to fight for his place at the Blues.
The 26-year-old, who cost Chelsea £72m when he joined the West London club from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, has been relegated to the substitutes’ bench following a series of high-profile errors.
He also lost his place to Willy Caballero towards the end of last season.
The Spaniard now faces competitions from Mendy and Cabellero under Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard’s squad.
Asked about his future at Chelsea while on international duty with Spain ahead of their friendly clash with Portugal on Wednesday night, Kepa said as quoted by Metro UK: “I feel good, strong and confident.
“Maybe it’s not the dream situation, but sometimes these things happen. I am confident I will turn my form around. I don’t have the feeling of being a substitute. We have three goalkeepers [at Chelsea], and the level is very high.
“He (Lampard) is the coach who chooses the eleven, and we have to try to do our best, and if we do not play, we must try as much as possible.”
He added: “In the life of the footballer there are ups and downs. My situation is not the same as last year. I only have to work and show my qualities.
