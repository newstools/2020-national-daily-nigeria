Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) says it will downsize its workforce in Nigeria by 25 per cent across various levels in the oil firm, a development frowned at by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN).
The oil firm said the development followed the evolving negative operational environment in the energy sector.
Esimaje Brikinn, CNL’s General Manager Policy, Government and Public Affairs, in a response statement, noted that the 25 per cent job cut was to reposition the oil firm for greater efficiency and competitiveness.
The statement was, however, silent on the exact number of workers to be affected by the job cut, but said that 25 per cent of its workers will be sacked.
“CNL and its affiliates, confirms that it is reviewing its manpower requirements in the light of the changing business environment, while continuing to evaluate opportunities to improve capital efficiency and reduce operating costs.
“In this process, the company will be streamlining its workforce and improving service delivery and overall performance at all levels. This will increase efficiency and effectiveness, retain value, reduce cost, and generate more revenue for the Federal Government of Nigeria.
“CNL supports the Federal Government in its objectives and efforts to build a prosperous Nigeria. In the area of employment generation, the company has several social investments which are helping to provide employment for thousands of Nigerians,” the statement read in part.
He dismissed speculations that the exercise was to outsource jobs done by Nigerians to foreigners, adding that there are no plans to migrate Nigerian jobs outside the country.
