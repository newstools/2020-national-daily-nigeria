The Department of State Security Service (DSS), on Monday disclosed the arrest of a suspected political thug, Ade Basket, and five others over the fracas between supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  in Akure on Sunday. It was gathered that they are suspected to be working for a governorship candidate in the build up to the October 10 election in Ondo State.
Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Ondo State, Adebo, known as Ìdájọ́, was said to have flee the city on arrival of the DSS operatives who intervened to contain the electoral violence on Sunday.  Ìdájọ́ was identified to be working for a governorship candidate, obstructing electioneering campaigns and other political activities of opponents towards the Saturday polls in Akure, instigating violent clashes between political parties.
The fracas was said to have commenced on Saturday night, causing many people to be injured. The DSS operatives were said to move in when the violence continued on Sunday morning after a young man was reported dead at Oke Jebu, an adjacent location to the heart of the city, Akure.
The DSS operatives have mounted manhunt for Adebo, Ìdájọ́, the NURTW Chairman, who is still on the run.
