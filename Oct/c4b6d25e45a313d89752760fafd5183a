Three governors in the United States (US), have commended President Donald Trump for appointing Judge Amy Coney Barrett for U.S. Supreme Court. Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama, Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Governor Kim Reynolds Iowa praised Trump for picking a female Judge Barrett into the Supreme Court.
They noted that a century ago, the Suffragettes finally succeeded in winning the right to vote for women. It excited them that a woman has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. They have intensified lobby for the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett as a judge of the US Supreme Court. They have been molesting votes for her.
They had the confidence that the four female justices nominated before Barrett were confirmed with lopsided votes by the U.S. Senate: 99-0 for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, 68-31 for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 63-37 for Justice Elena Kagan and 96-3 for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
The governors expressed their proudness in seeing diversity expand among the highest levels of government. They, however, explained that their support for Judge Barrett is not connected to her being a female but rather her superior intellect, unflappable composure and impeccable integrity, all which combine to make her eminently qualified in every way.
They reiterated their optimism that she will scale through the US Senate confirmation.
