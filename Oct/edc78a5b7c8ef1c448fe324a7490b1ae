Suspected hoodlums disguised as #ENDSARS protesters on Monday attacked operatives of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS), injuring about 14 officers.
Armed with sticks and bottles, the hoodlums in their hundreds barricaded the RRS truck, pelting the operatives who were on their way to relieve their colleagues who have been on duty since Sunday at Ebute Meta, with stones.
Already, some of the injured have been moved to the Police Clinic Ikeja and others were taken to the General Hospital for medical attention.
Condemning the attacks on policemen, Lagos Police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, noted some of the protesters have exhibited violent traits and disdain for the police, urging them to desist from the needless provocation of operatives.
He lamented that many policemen have been injured in Adekunle area of Yaba, adding that many of those protesting were too aggressive and do not want to see the police around them.
He appealed to the protesters to get organised and have a structure so they can easily communicate the reason(s) of the protests to supporters to avoid misrepresentation and anarchy.
