Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has imposed a 24-hour curfew on the state following spate of violence in the on-going #ENDSARS protest
Sanwo-olu said this in a statement on Monday.
“I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the well-being of our society. Lives and limbs have been lost as criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem on our state.
“As a government that is alive to its responsibility and has shown a commitment to the movement #ENDSARS, we will not watch and allow anarchy in our dear state.
“I, therefore, hereby impose a 24-hour curfew on all parts of the State as from 4pm today, 20th October, 2020. Nobody, except essential service providers and first responders must be found on the streets.”
Lagos follows Edo in declaration of emergency as confrontations between the protesting youth and police continue to increase.
The youth protesting have presented demands which the federal government has made effort to meet after accepting all of the demands. State governors have also adopted the proposal by the Nigerian Governors Forum to meet the five-point demand of the protesters.
But the youth have remained in the streets, occupying highways and major economic hubs across the southwest and southeast and Abuja since the the early days of the two-week old agitation.
The curfew begin 4 pm October 20.
Only essential workers are allowed to move about.
