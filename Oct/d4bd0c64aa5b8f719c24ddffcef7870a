In respect of the on-going youth-led protest to reform the Nigerian police, Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has made another move after setting up  a multimillion-naira fund for victims of police brutality.
He has now constituted a Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS which include, as part of its members, protesters from the ENDSARS movement generally believed to e leaderless.
Sanwo-Olu recently met with President Muhammadu Buhari, the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, and the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) before setting up the panel.
According to him, it has taken a powerful youth led action to drive reform and hopefully begin the process that truly delivers a citizen-friendly police.
The panel comprises seven members chosen from the judiciary, CSO, and ENDSARS Movement.
Heading the panel is retired Justice Doris Okuwobi, while members include Ebun Adegboruwa, SAN (representing the civil society), Taiwo Lakanu (a retired deputy inspector-general of police), Patience Udoh (representing the civil society), and Segun Awosanya aka Segalink (Human Rights Activist).
Others are Olutoyin Odusanya (Director, Citizens Mediation Center), a rep/member of the youth-led protest and a representative of the Human Rights Commission.
There will be a help desk for the complaints and petitions to the panel.
Lagosians will be able to reach the panel directly on 0901 051 3203; 3204 and 3205 from next week.
ENDSARS as a movement has been largely impregnable because there are no identified leaders to dialogue with or make responsible for the protest.
Appointing some of the members as panel members may have given the government an in-road to the movement.
