Buba Galadima, the leader of the renegade nAPC, has revealed how officials of a state government approached him to sell food items provided by the Coalition Against Covid-19 to ease the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable.
But his reveltion might not be exactly unrelated to politics as the coalition itself cleared the air on the reason the palliatives delayed this long
He said this on AIT on October 26.
“I know of a state that all the palliatives taken from the Federal Government in that state were kept in stores and they came to my office to look for buyers of such commodities,” he said.
“They said the buyers should not be from that particular state.”
Most of the governrs have denied hoarding the palliatives as citizens busted many of the warehouses where these provisions were stored.
A statement from CACOVID has however further illuminated the situation.
“The sheer scale of this nationwide food programme and the timing of the orders and deliveries, which coincided with the lockdowns and reduced movement across the country, compelled CACOVID to roll out distribution in a staggered manner,” a statement by the coalition’s spokesperson Nwanosiobi Osita said in Abuja on Monday.
CACOVID is a group of industrialists and philanthropists who came together and raised N23bn to help tide the poorest Nigerians, 10 million of them, through the hardship of the covid-19 pandemic.
The group is chaired by Dangote Group chairman Aliko Dangote.
