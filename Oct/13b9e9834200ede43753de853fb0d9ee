There are emerging indicators of fresh crisis looming in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over elongation of the tenure of the Caretaker Committee. Several stakeholders have rejected plans to extend the tenure of the committee, insisting on the conduct of national convention of the election of the party leadership.
Some party stakeholders under the aegis of ‘Concerned All Progressives Congress (APC) Members’ revolted and issued the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni  of Yobe State, 14-day ultimatum to set out plans for convening a national convention in December.
The Concerned APC Members expressed vehement opposition to any plan to extend the tenure of the caretaker committee, protesting that it is going to be counterproductive.
APC at the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) on June 25 appointed the Buni-led Caretaker Committee after the dissolution of the National Working Committee (NWC) led by the deposed national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.
The Caretaker Committee had six months duration to reconcile members in conflicts and convene an elective national convention within the period.
The committee has not shown any intention of winding up or convening an elective national convention. Opposition has continued to mount against any extension of tenure as pressures intensify for national convention in November.
