Nigerian singer Wizkid on Tuesday night aimed another jibes at the Presidency, this time at President Muhammadu Buhari’s new media aide, Lauretta Onochie as the #EndSARS campaign gathered momentum among celebrities in the country.
Recall that the musician had on Monday described President Buhari as an old man, and Lauretta had in turn called him a ‘Dumbkid’ for disrespecting the President.
However, replying on his twitter page, Wizkid said: “Shame on you. Lol a 77 year old man is not a young ma.. You are a woman and a mother and kids are getting killed by police/sars and this is all you have to say? Shame on you!!! Shame on you!! I am a father and age has nothing to do with demanding for better governance in my country!!”
Lauretta explained why Wizkid deserved the new nickname in her tweet on Tuesday:
“It’s not disrespectful to call anyone old. It’s the way and manner Ayo Balogun addressed the President that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. He exhibited crass ignorance, insensitivity and childishness. But hey, he’s a #DumbkidNotWhizKid
“When he grows up, he might learn respect”.
