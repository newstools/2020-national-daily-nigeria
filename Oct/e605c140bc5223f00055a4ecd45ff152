According to Commissioner for Education Folasade Adefisayo, LASG approves reopening of schools from Monday’.
“The Lagos State Government has approved the re-opening of schools for all classes in public and private schools across the State beginning from Monday, 2nd of November, 2020 while boarders in public schools are to resume on Sunday, 1st of the same month,” the statement read.
“This has been an unprecedented year with the recent happenings that have regrettably led to frequent closure of schools with attendant learning disruptions faced by all children.
“We pray and hope that there will be no more disruptions in the academic calendar. However, the State Government will always regard the safety of pupils/students, parents and all staff as a matter of priority.” She stressed.
“We recommend that when schools resume on Monday, teaching and learning should continue unhindered till the end of the term.”
