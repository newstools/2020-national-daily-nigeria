A video clip emerged on Wednesday on the social media showing how Nigerians resident in France purportedly chased the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, out of a hotel where he lodged in the country. The Nigerians were gathered at the hotel repeatedly shouting “shame on you” as the French Police led the man out of the hotel.
It was gathered that the Nigerians in France had gone in search of the APC leader who departed Nigeria in the wake of the military onslaught of unarmed #EndSARS peaceful protesters at Lekki toll gate in Lagos on Tuesday night. He was earlier said to be lodging in a hotel at the Charles de Gaulle area in France but the Nigerian residents were searching the particular hotel.
The video which trended on the social media indicated that the residents eventually found the ‘hideout’ and sustained protest rhere, which was embarrassing to the management of the hotel, leading to the invitation of the police. The policemen were seen in the video escorting the man out of the hotel.
