The Nigeria Police on Monday broke public trust in the force on police reform or heeding to the demands of the #ENDSARS protesters in Abuja. the police in a seeming unrepentant attitude, fired teargas at peaceful #EndSARS protesters in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
The #ENDSARS protesters, demanding an end to police brutality, extortion and extra-judicial killings, going through the John Kennedy Street towards the back gate of the Presidential Villa, Abuja, were obstructed by the police who fired teargas at the protesters in a bid to disperse the crowd.
Later on Monday evening, the police and officers of the Nigerian Army intercepted people who went for the #ENDSARS protested at Mararaba/Nyanya, Nasarawa State, on their way home, where they were said to be punished.
Earlier in the day, the #ENDSARS protesters were not deterred by the presence of security operatives in several parts of Abuja which include the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corp (NSCDC), as well as the Nigerian Army stationed in front of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) headquarters.
