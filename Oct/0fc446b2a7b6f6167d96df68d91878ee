Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has asked the federal government to listen to the calls for restructuring.

Recall that the presidency had in a statement released last weekend, slammed those clamouring for restructuring and also described them as “unpatriotic and unwarranted”.

However in a statement released by Ortom’s chief press secretary Terver Akase,  the Benue state Governor asked the federal government not to suppress the right of the people to voice their opinions because we are not living in a military regime.

He added that it is incumbent on the Federal Government to listen to the views of the people and evolve acceptable ways of addressing the problems confronting the country instead of engaging in a “combative style.”

The statement read;

“Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom urges the Federal Government not to dismiss calls for the restructuring of the country and other views expressed by the people as ‘unpatriotic outbursts.

“Nigeria is practising democracy which guarantees the freedom of speech to all citizens and not military regime which suppresses the right of the people to voice their opinions about challenges facing their country.

“It is incumbent on the Federal Government to listen to the views of the people and evolve acceptable ways of addressing the problems confronting the country instead of engaging in a combative style, anyone who dares to suggest alternative approaches to tackling the challenges.

“Great nations of the world got to their enviable status by harnessing and utilising ideas of their citizens, not by discouraging those who made bold submissions on the development of their countries.”
