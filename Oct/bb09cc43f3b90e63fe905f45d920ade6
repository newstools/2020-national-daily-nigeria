After taking down the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission Twitter and the CBN website, Anonymous attacked the EFCC and INEC on Friday, day 8 of the #ENDSARS protest in most of Nigeria’s south and east.
Both agencies are temporarily taken off the internet now.
“Official website of @officialEFCC has been taken down in support of #EndSARSProtest. CHECK HOST: https://check-host.net/check-report/df89d3bk838 TARGET: https://efccnigeria.org/efcc/ You should have expected us! #EndCorruptionInNigeria,” Anonymous tweeted, adding it was done in solidarity with  the #EndSARS protesters.
While corruption remains the reason for hacking the EFCC website, the N5-million fine the NBC imposed on convicts of hate speeches drew the anger of the hackers.
But all of the retaliations are coming at a time Nigerian youth are rampaging against the government for the atrocities of the disbanded SARS operatives in many parts of Nigeria.
Despite having their five-point demand met, the youth have refused to end the protest.
