Retired Captain Idahosa Okunbo is sick, and he has revealed why and where he is–in order to rebuff the rumour doing the round on how and why he got sick.
Many have said on social media the loss of the APC candidate Osagie Ize Iyamu in the last guber election in Edo made him fall sick.
He, however, debunked it.
“I have never claimed to be a superhuman being.  I do not deny the fact that I am not well.  I am outside the country for my medicals, which were delayed because of the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in statement.
According to him, after a series of tests, my doctors confirmed that I have some health issues.
“It is, therefore, ill-advised and inhuman for those who are not comfortable with the position I took in the Edo election to joyfully circulate in the social media that I have health issues and that I have slid into coma. Well, I leave them all to God,” he said.
He added that the last Edo election was the reason the malicious rumour was trending.
“Those who are opposed to me for taking a position in the election, which they won, should leave me alone and get busy with their life,” he said, saying he was grateful to God for the life he lived and legacy he has at 60.
Osunbo was maong the crowd loyal to the APC former national chairman Adams Oshiomhole whose candidate Ize-Iyamu contested against Gov Godwin Obaseki frozen out of the party into the APC before the September 19 election which he won.
