The Nigerian Army after the massacre of innocent #EndSARS peaceful protesters on Tuesday night at Lekki Toll gate set the scene on fire for whatever reason. The soldiers were also said to have confiscated the dead bodies of the people gunned down by their bullets.
It is unthinkable that the innocent citizens who were scampering for safety in the gunfire would have a second thought or the time to set the venue on fire which they have not done in the past one and a half week of the protest.
Some who were lying on the ground during the massacre used their mobile phone to record the sound of gunshots crying for help.
The Nigerian Senate had at the Tuesday plenary requested President Muhammadu Buhari to make a national broadcast on the #EndSARS protest by the Nigeria youths agitating police brutality and extra-judicial killings by the Nigeria police.
