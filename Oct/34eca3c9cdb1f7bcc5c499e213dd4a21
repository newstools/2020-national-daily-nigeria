An aide to a member of the House of Representatives was on Friday caught with the aid of a camera attempting to steal from the office of another lawmaker in the National Assembly.    The legislative aide identified as Kabir Lawal, was said to have allegedly broken into another member’s office in the House of Representatives.
The aide to Mustafa Saidu (PDP/Adamawa), had purportedly forced his way into the office of Kabiru Idris from Kano State, but was caught through an image monitor from a Closed-Circuit Television camera before he could cause any damage.
Hon. Kabiru Idris, Chairman of the House Committee on Civil Society Organisations and Donor Agencies, was gathered to have narrated that the suspect had trailed his movement and about 15 minutes he departed from office, the suspect tried to open the door to his office on the fourth floor with several keys but none of the keys worked. Then, the suspect broke the door and forced his way into his office. Unfortunately, for the suspect, the lawmaker saw the signal and was monitoring him while on transit.
According to the legislator: “He put off the light in my office, but I was able to keep an eye on it. I set my cameras live. “I could see him online. He used different keys. I could see from the camera; he was struggling to open the door, and this was less than 15 minutes after I closed from the office.
“Basically, he was monitoring my movement. There and then, we now saw how he came into the office. We have all the videos.”
The suspect was caught in the act as the legislator made a sudden U-turn and came back to office unannounced. He tried to beg his captors but failed to convince them not to expose him.
The legislative aide is being interrogated by the National Assembly management.
