Majority Leader in the Lagos State House Of Assembly, Hon. Sanai Oyeniran Agunbiade has expressed sadness over the killings of armless #EndSARS protesters in Lekki Toll Gate area of the state on Tuesday 20th October, 2020.
Agunbiade, representing Ikorodu 1 Constituency, made this known in a statement he personally signed and which was made available to journalists.
The lawmaker emphasized that these were not the best of times for Nigeria as a country “and us as a people. An hitherto peaceful protest has turned into a bloody scenario. I am sad.”
He revealed that he had led protests as a member of human rights movement and as President of the Student Union in the Students Movement, adding that he wouldn’t have been here if he had been killed.
“It is in the light of the above and in the reasoning that only the living aspires that I speak strongly against the killing of some protesters in the ongoing nationwide #EndSARS protest. The killing is condemnable and no less are the perpetrators.
“Cloud of grief envelopes our country and there are ominous signs of uncertainty everywhere. So sad.
“All I could urge us now is to pray fervently that God heals our land and grant us enabling peace to do justice.
“Tough time don’t last, but though men do. Let’s remain strong and be fat in faith that God will intervene in our glaring predicament.
“May the souls of the fallen heroes be admitted to the Graceland of heaven,” the statement read.
