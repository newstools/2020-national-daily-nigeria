As Nigerian youth sustain their protest for the federal government to cancel the most brutal unit of the Nigerian police force, SARS, the possibilities of more casualties are increasing especially in Lagos, Abuja, and other volatile states in the southwest
A protester was killed in Lagos on Monday in the sustained call on President Muhammadu Buhari to make the cancellation of the unit more credible.
The young man dressed in a red T-shirt and black trouser gave up after efforts by young medics failed.
Armed policemen are apparently firing live rounds at the protesters.
The Lagos killing followed that of Ogbomosho, Oyo, on Saturday.
No fewer than five people have been killed so far across the nation since the protest started October 8.
