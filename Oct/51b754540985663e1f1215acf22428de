As ENDSARS protests intensify across the southern part of Nigeria, the federal government has finally taken steps to put down the agitation as violence erupts.
Soldiers have now been deployed to the streets of Abuja to arrest the escalating #ENDSARS protests.
Hoodlums and pro-SARS protesters have been clashing with protesters in Abuja, Lagos, Benin, and other states. Police stations and prison facilities have also been attacked in the process.
In the lead-up to the Monday incident, the federal government warned it would not watch the situation degenerate to anarchy. The army also said it would not allow the nationâ€™s democracy broken by hoodlums perpetrating violence.
Which is why armed soldiers were deployed to the AYA Roundabout where the protesters had planned to block on Monday.
Other parts of Abuja have also been manned same way.
