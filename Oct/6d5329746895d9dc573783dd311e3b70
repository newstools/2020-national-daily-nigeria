Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki has reacted to the emotion-dripping release by APC’s stalwart  Idahos Okunbo about his fallen health after his candidate Osagie Ize-yamu lost in the guber election to te PDP candidate.
The National Daily earlier reported the speculation Okunbo broke down because of the loss. But the retired captain later dismissed the rumour, and explained he is abroad taking care of himself, and that those still angry he took a stand in the election should just leave him alone.
Reacting to the statement, Obaseki, in a letter he signed, sympathised with Okunbo.
“I assure you my household and all your well wishers would continually have you n prayers in this trying time,” the governor said, adding everyone will respect his privacy as he recovers.
