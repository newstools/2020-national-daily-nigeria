Some Nigerians have faulted the claim of a woman who alleged that her son, Anthony died after soldiers opened fire on unarmed #EndSARS protesters at Lekki toll gate.
Though the woman’s identity is yet to be uncovered after the viral video, it was however gathered that she said her son’s corpse was recovered by his friends. She further stated that she is yet to be visited by government officials.
Reacting to the video, a Facebook user identified as Pretty Loveth alleged that Anthony died after he and his friends bumped into a trailer on their way home.
She wrote
“He didn’t die at Lekki tollgate, him (he) and his two friends bumped into a trailer on their way home at Petrocam Filling Station, close to Lagos Business School, Ajah. RIP Tony, we all miss you brother.”
A Twitter user Ijaw Philosopher also wrote;
“Tony Umeh was among the three people that had an accident on their way back from the protest before the toll gate incident, so why is this London woman alleged to be his mother claiming he was killed by the military? I felt something was off about her and you guys rained insults”
