The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday opposed the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, Professor Eyitope Ogungbenro Ogunbodede, as the Chief Returning Officer for the Ondo State governorship election.
The PDP in a statement by the chairman of the PDP Ondo State Governorship National Campaign Council, Seyi Makinde, protested that Professor Ogunbodede is a known crony of the All Progressives Congress (APC), governorship candidate, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, sayong that both of them are from the same town, Owo, in Ondo north.
The PDP argued that Prof. Ogunbodede will not be fair in the discharge of his duty as the Ondo Governorship election Chief Returning Officer.
The party declared: “It has come to our knowledge that the people of Ondo State will not be getting free and fair elections if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as presently composed will be overseeing the elections.
“We are speaking in particular about the appointment of Professor Eyitope Ogungbenro Ogunbodede, the Vice-Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife as the Chief Returning Officer of the Ondo State Governorship election.
“The PDP totally rejects Prof. Ogunbodede as the Chief Returning Officer, he is a known crony of Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the same hometown as the candidate. He cannot be a fair party in the proceedings by virtue of their association.”
