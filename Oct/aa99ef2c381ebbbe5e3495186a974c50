Following directives by federal government that Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) should suspend the implementation of the new hike in electricity tariff for two weeks, the Ministry of Power has urged Nigerians to report to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) if their electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) failed to comply with the directive to reverse tariff prices.
Recall that the Nigerian Labour Congress and the Federal Government agreed to suspend the electricity tariff increase for a period of two weeks as part of the agreement reached between Labour and the Government to avert a nationwide strike that would have grounded an already deteriorating economy.
The meeting also resolved that the following issues of concern to Labour should be treated as stand-alone items: The 40% stake of government in the DISCO and the stake of workers to be reflected in the composition of the DISCOs Boards.
An all-inclusive and independent review of the power sector operations as provided in the privatization MOU to be undertaken before the end of the year 2020, with Labour represented.
That going forward, the moribund National Labour Advisory Council, NLAC, will be inaugurated before the end of the year 2020 to institutionalize the process of tripartism and social dialogue on socio-economic and major labour matters to forestall the crisis.
In the ministry of power official twitter handle, it directed affected customers to report any erring DisCo to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.
It tweeted, “Has your DisCo complied with the directive to reverse tariff prices issued by @NERCNG this week? Let us know via this handle or @NERCNG.”
