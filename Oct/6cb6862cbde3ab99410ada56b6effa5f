Lance Corporal Harrison Friday who masked up on social media, and advises his colleagues not to attack #EndSARS protesters has been arrested and charged with a crime.
“The fight the civilians are fighting is our fight, do not let them (the Nigerian government) use us,” Friday said in a video uploaded on Facebook last week.
October 20, however, soldiers from the 81 Division had been accused of killing protesters at the Lekki tollgate on Tuesday night, an allegation the army has denied.
The army announced on Twitter that the corporal had been arrested for cybercrime on October21.
“The hooded soldier hiding behind the mask to commit cybercrimes has been apprehended in the ongoing cyber operations in support of crocodile smile. Rest assured cybercriminals have no hiding place,” it tweeted.
Nigeria has been engulfed in violent protests since October 20 as youth protesting police brutality came under fire in Lagos after a curfew declared by Gov. Babajide Sanwo Olu.
