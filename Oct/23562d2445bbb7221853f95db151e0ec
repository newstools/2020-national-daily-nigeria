Music superstar Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley on Tuesday alleged that the #EndSARS campaign is being sponsored by armed robbers who were afraid of the controversial police unit.
He disclosed this during an Instagram Live interview with the spokesman of the Nigeria Police Force, Frank Mba.
Recall that Soapy crooner had earlier canceled the #EndSars protest he planned to lead today.
The Afro-Pop star announced via Twitter that he won’t be protesting anymore because the police force is making a lot of changes.
He said angry youths who are ready to join his protest should give the police a week grace before a mass protest.
The Nigeria Police Force responded to the cancellation by announcing an Instagram Live interview with its spokesman Frank Mba.
During the live interview, Naira Marley condemned the #EndSARS campaign, alleging it was powered by armed robbers.
He said there was no need to disband the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit of the police against which many Nigerians have been kicking.
According to him: “We need to reform SARS. Let’s be reasonable, are you an armed robber? Why will you say they should end SARS? If you end SARS, it means they should end EFCC and other agencies. All we have to do is get them off the road.
“Nobody threatened me, I know my rights. What stopped me was thinking of the safety of everybody and I saw that the police issued a statement.”
Meanwhile, another Nigerian singer Douglas Jack Agu popularly known as Runtown has confirmed he will be leading a protest against the terror carried out by men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) on Thursday.
“This has gone long enough and now we MUST take action! I’ll be leading a protest to #ENDSARS on Thursday, October 8th 2020. They MUST listen to us, they MUST make/effect REAL and VISIBLE changes! Empty promises won’t work this time!!!
