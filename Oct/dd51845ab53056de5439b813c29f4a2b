Ikeja under the bridge boiled on Friday as police engaged hoodlums in heavy gun-battle as the hoodlums attempted to loot shops in the popular computer village.
The hoodlums who came out in large numbers on Friday morning took over the road leading to the Ikeja General Hospital to loot properties in the vicinity.
They attempted to break into the popular Computer Village to loot properties, but the police repelled them moving as gunfire boomed in the area.
There was pandemonium as residents scamper to safety. People were locked in their houses as hoodlums held sway.
A viral video showed properties being set ablaze by hoodlums as thick smokes bellowed the atmospheres.
Computer Village taskforce members, with members of the Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC, were seen with machetes patrolling the village to ensure that the repelled hoodlums did not return.
The hoodlums had also attempted to break into the Ikeja City Mall on Thursday to loot properties but the police repelled them and are keeping vigil at the mall.
