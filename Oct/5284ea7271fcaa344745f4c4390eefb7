The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor E. A. Adeboye, has condemned the massacre of unarmed Nigerian youths at the Lekki toll gate, Lagos, on Tuesday night by gunmen dressed in Army uniform. The renowned Man of God demanded justice for victims of the onslaught from the Nigerian government.
Pastor Adeboye in a statement “I condemn in the strongest possible terms, attacks launched by the Nigerian military on unarmed young people, who have been peacefully protesting police brutality in the last 12 days as #EndSARS protest.
“I am confused that prior to the sad event at #LEKKITOLLGATE, the Nigerian police failed to arrest the weapon bearing hoodlums who were attacking the well-organised and non-violent #ENDSARS protesters.”
He noted that the condemnable actions of the military risks driving the agitations of the young people underground, thereby making the situation unmanageable. “I call on the Federal Government to thoroughly investigate the tragic event at Lekki and other parts of the country, give justice to all victims, even as it engages the #EndSARS protesters to reach a common agreement to end police brutality.
“I am also appealing to the youths to allow peace reign and stop any form of action that would give the military any other chance for violence.”
He prayed for peace in Nigeria
