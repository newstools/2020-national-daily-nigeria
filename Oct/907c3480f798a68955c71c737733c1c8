In spite of the on-going curfew in Plateau, hundreds of youth still came out searching for Covid-19 palliatives to loot, and, as it happened, they invaded the house of former Speaker Yakubu Dogara in Jos on Sunday at about 9 am.
Policemen and other security operatives enforcing the curfew shot to disperse the rampaging youth .
According to eyewitnesses, the invaders attacked Dogara’s brother, and moved out whatever they found, including tricycles, furniture, gadgets, and others.
Dogara is a native of Bauchi.
Since the Tuesday night ENDSRAS shooting at Lekki, Lagos, many states have declared curfews with no effect as looting, arson, and killing continue.
Warehouses of covid-19 palliatives have been the targets of most of the attackers many call hoodlums. So far, warehouses in Lagos, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo, Plateau, Taraba, Cross Rivers have been looted.
