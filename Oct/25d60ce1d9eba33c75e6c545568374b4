President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday held an emergency meeting with the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, at the State House, Abuja. National Daily gathered that urgent meeting convened at the instance of the President was not unconnected with the nationwide #ENDSARS protests across the country and the corresponding #E#ndinsecurity protests in the north.
The meeting came after the Nigerian Army has threatened the commencement of military operations of “Crocodile Smile” on Tuesday amidst the #ENDSARS protests by Nigerian youths.
Few other  principal officers in the presidency were in attendance at the meeting, which was still ongoing at the time of this report.
