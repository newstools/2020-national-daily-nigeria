There appears to be rising tension in Abuja since the shooting of unarmed #EndSARS peaceful peresters at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos on Tuesday by gunmen in army uniform, leaving many Nigerian youths groaning in pains from bullet hits. Some were said to have died in the onslaught.
The broadcast of President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday appeared not to have communicated any message to Nigerians on the violent uprising in the country. Protests continued in Abuja on Friday.
Meanwhile, President Buhari on Friday convened an emergency meeting with former Nigerian leaders. The meeting was held via virtual communications and was also attended by service chiefs and senior government officials.
The virtual meeting was being attended by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, former President Goodluck Jonathan, former head of state Abdulsalami Abubakar, Ernest Shonekan and General Yakubu Gowon.
Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, and National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, including Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, as well as the DG of the SSS were also in attendance at the meeting which was said to have held at about 9.00a.m.
The meeting, according to sources, was to deliberate on the #EndSARS protests by Nigerian youths agitating against police brutality, extra-judicial killings by the Nigerian Police, and demands for police reforms and good governance.
