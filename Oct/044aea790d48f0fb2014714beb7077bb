Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Church Worldwide, Bishop David Oyedepo, has attributed his silence over the ongoing #EndSARS protests rocking the country to his experience over the years.
Oyedepo who spoke on Sunday at Canaanland in Ota, Ogun state, said he warned Nigeria vehemently in 2015 about the current crisis but was humiliated. “I kept quiet for a while because in 2015 I warned this nation, vehemently, consistently, because I saw the dangers ahead and you can tell.
Bishop Oyedopo also called on Christians to pray for God’s judgement on those behind the killings in the country.
He backed protesters saying that every man has the legitimate right to express his displeasure and pains.
The cleric described shooting peaceful protesters as sacrilege. “It would be a sacrilege to shoot the protesters who are not looting, who are not ravaging. When you push a goat to the wall then you will know that goats have teeth to bite.
“It is a sacrilege to kill youths during a protest, this protest is legitimate,” he added.
