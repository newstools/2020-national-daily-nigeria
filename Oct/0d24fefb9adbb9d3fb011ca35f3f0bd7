The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Thursday, celebrated the successful compliance with the sit-at-home order issued by the IPOD leader, Nnamdi Kanu, in the southeast states. IPOB in a statement by Emma Powerful, the Media and Publicity Director, indicated that the leader, Nnamdi Kanu, had acknowledged: “Today’s Sit-a- home order issued by the global movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on 1st of October 2020 is totally successful in so many states and cities in Biafraland.”
He highlighted that all states in Biafraland complied with the order, from Abia State, to Rivers, Ebonyi, Anambra, Imo, Delta and other states in Biafraland.
Kanu, therefore, declared: “The compliance of this order is to showcase our readiness for the speedy coming of Biafra freedom and independence. “There are empty markets, roads, no vehicles on the road of Biafra and Biafrans all over the world are on the streets of their respective countries where they find themselves with our brethren from Oduduwa nation.
“We thank our people in South Africa, USA, Canada, Britain, France, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, Australia and other countries of the world for their resoluteness and declared to the world that we are no longer interested in Nigeria. The whole world must understand that IPOB cannot go back to Nigeria.
“This is our joint outing with the Oduduwa nation across the globe therefore everybody must understand and be sure that the disintegration of this British bondage called Nigeria will dissolve in peace.”
