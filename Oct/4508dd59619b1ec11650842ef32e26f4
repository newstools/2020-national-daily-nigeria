Multichoice Nigeria, owners of DStv and GOtv, has given reasons why it decided to open all its channels to customers.
The company in a statement said contrary to some reports that its network was hacked, it decided to open all of its channels because during the upgrade the subscribers would have difficulties accessing some channels on their bouquets.
“Instead of allowing subscribers to go through such a challenge, we decided to open all channels till the upgrade is over.”
It stated, “Please be informed that Multichoice offices are undergoing a system upgrade from 11 pm Saturday October 17 to 4pm Monday, October 19, 2020.We apologise for inconveniences this may cause.”
