Two persons have been confirmed killed and several others injured when some hoodlums called Ogbe Boys attacked #EndSARS protesters in Edo state on Friday.
The hoodlums who claimed they are revenue collectors for Oredo local government council in Benin City, accused the protesters of preventing them from collecting money from vehicles using the car park.
It was gathered that the hoodlums suddenly appeared with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons to attack the protesters. While the protesting youths took to their heels, others stayed back to persuade the hoodlums that the peaceful protest was for all of the youths and that they were not out to fight anybody.
It was further learnt that the hoodlums who were clad in red T-shirts, were saying “why are they disturbing our work,” and in the process brought guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons to attack the protesting youths.
Some of those who received gunshot injuries in the ensuing violence were later rushed to the nearby Central Hospital.
One of the injured persons, Abere Godswill, said the hoodlums descended on him thinking he wanted to video as they removed cutlasses from their vehicle
“I didn’t join the protest, I was coming from the bank when I met them on the road. Because I held my phone in my hand, they started beating me saying I wanted to video them. They collected the phone and I had to run for my life,” he said
Also speaking, one of the protesters, Efosa Igbinoba, said they were at the Ring Road to protest police brutality and good governance in Nigeria, only to be attacked by hoodlums.
“We started the protest from Sapele Road, but on getting to the Ring Road, hoodlums just appeared from nowhere with cutlasses and guns to attack us and disrupt the protest
The youths however, later regrouped after the hoodlums had been chased away and continued the protest.
