The report of the Presidential Panel on SARS Reforms has recommended dismissal of 33 officers of the defunct squad, N265.7 million paid as compensation to victims of rights violations.
The panel, chaired by the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Tony Ojukwu, released its report on Tuesday.
The panel also recommended prosecution of 33 SARS officers, 26 cases for further investigation, 57 in which victims are to be compensated, 2 cases in which pending court orders are to be obeyed by the police.
It also recommended public apology for over 32 cases of rights violations, to be published in newspapers and other means.
Nigerians, mostly youth, have been out for two weeks all over the west and east, protesting the brutality of the squad, prompting President Muhammadu Buhari to disband it, and set up a panel to investigate and recommend compensation and punishment for victims and perpetrators respectively.
But in spite of the effort made at the federal and state levels, demonstration continued, sometime violently, until Edo, Lagos, ad Ekiti declared state of emergency yesterday and today.
