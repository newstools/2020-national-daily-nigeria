Following widespread looting and arson by suspected hoodlums across the nation in the wake of the ENDSARS protest by Nigerian youth, IGP Mohammed Adamu has ordered police commanders move into action.
Adamu directed the immediate mobilisation of all police operational assets and resources to bring an end to the wanton violence, killings, looting and destruction of public and private property, and reclaim the public space from “criminal elements masquerading as protesters in some parts of the country.”
In a statement by the Force spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, the IGP gave the order to all Assistant Inspectors -General of Police, Commissioners of Police, heads of police operational Units, Squadron and Base Commanders in charge of Zonal/State/FCT Commands, the Police Mobile Force, Counter-Terrorism Unit and the Special Protection Unit, on October 24, 2020.
“In addition, CPs and heads of police formations in the various states had also been charged to mobilize their men and work in sync with the command CPs in the areas where they are domiciled, to dominate the public space and ensure peace and safety in the affected areas,” the statement said.
Since Tuesday when Lagos Gov Babajide Sanwo Olu declred a curfew, many of the states in the west , east and south south have been plunged into looting and violence.
