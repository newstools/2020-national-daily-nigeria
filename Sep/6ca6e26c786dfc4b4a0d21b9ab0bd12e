Chibok Local Government of Borno State is now participating in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WAEC) for the first time in 6 years.

The Borno local government is now participating in the examination after over 200 schoolgirls were abducted in the area by Boko Haram insurgents on April 14, 2014. Following the abduction of the schoolgirls, the Federal Government had closed down schools in the area.

The 7 Division of the Nigerian Army confirmed the reopening of schools in the local government, and it was further learnt that the Government Girls’ Secondary School Chibok has been converted into a mixed school.

Abdul-Khalifa Ibrahim, acting general officer commanding (GOC), 7 division who was represented by Ifeanyi Otu, chief of staff of the division said;

“It will be gladdening to note that for the first time in the past six years, WAEC successfully held WASSCE in Chibok with the military providing security.

“We are all witnesses to what happened in the recent past like the abduction of the Chibok girls, the slaughtering of students at Buni Yadi and abduction of students at Dapchi. These are all that happened and we have turned around that narrative.

“Let me equally say that the chief of army staff has been making deliberate efforts through the education corps to post teachers to all schools within the north-east states.

“We are really doing enough to ensure that education is resuscitated and as we all know, education is one thing that liberates the individual and liberates the minds. In the first place, this conflict would not have thrived if not that there was high illiteracy rate in this zone.”
