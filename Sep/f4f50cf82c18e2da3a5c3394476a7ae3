The housemate who was nominated for eviction alongside Laycon, Ozo and Dorathy in the ninth week of the reality show, was evicted after Trickytee was shown the exit door.
Following his eviction, Neo, Nengi, Dorathy, Laycon and Vee are now the housemates who made it to the finale of the reality show.
