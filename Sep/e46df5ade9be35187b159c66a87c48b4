The chief executive officer of the state has now acquired power to coordinate and decide response to Benue during emergencies of highly infectious diseases breakouts.
This is part of the provisions in the Highly Infectious Diseases bill, 2020, which the Benue State House of Assembly passed on Friday.
The clauses were considered in committee of the whole chaired by the Deputy Speaker Christopher Adaji and the debate was moderated by House Committee Chairman Health and Human Services, Joseph Okponya.
Okponya said it would prevent and contain the spread of highly infectious diseases such as coronavirus.
The bill contains regulations and guidelines to residents and informs them of the necessity of screening, testing and isolation.
It also imposes restriction of movements of people, events, gatherings, commercial activities; prohibits hoarding of foodstuffs, drugs and other essential supplies.
Others include restrictions on transportation, storage and disposal of COVID-19 victims and cautions against the transmission and spread of false information regarding the pandemic.
“It also aims at empowering and providing legal backing to the initiatives, activities and efforts of the Chief Executive Officer of the state, which is the Governor as well as the frontline health workers and practitioners that are directly involved in combating infectious diseases,” Okponya explained.
The National Assembly is in the process of passing a similar bill whose provisions are similar to the Benue bill except that it empowers the director-general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
