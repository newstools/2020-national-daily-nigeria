The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), has directed the 11 Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) in Nigeria to suspend the September 1 tariff increase for two weeks.
NERC in the directive ordered the DISCOs to with immediate effect suspend the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO) 2020 signed by Prof James Momoh, the NERC’s Chairman.
It was highlighted that the suspension followed a joint communiqué issued by the Federal Government and the Organised Labour after Sunday night negotiation in Abuja.
NERC in the order instructed the DisCos to halt the new tariff from Sept 28 to Oct 11 and revert all charges to the tariff existing as of Aug 31.
