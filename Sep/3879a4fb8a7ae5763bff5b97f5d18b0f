Incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has won the Saturday governorship election in the State. The governor floored Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole.
After the announcement of results from the 18 local governments on Sunday by the INEC, Obaseki won the majority votes and won 13 local governments while Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, candidate of the APC, won in 5 local governments. Incumbent Governor Obaseki and the PDP not only defeated Ize-Iyamu and the APC but crushed the godfather(s) in the state. The PDP and Obaseki have successfully led the Edo people to prove that Edo is not Lagos.
Meanwhile, the APC agent protested the result at the collation centre, threatening that the party has rejected the   result. However, official statement is still expected from the state party leadership and the candidate, Ize-Iyamu.
The results in the 18 local governments as announced by the INEC are as follows:
