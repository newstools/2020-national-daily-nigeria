Attorney-General of the Federation and justice Minister Abubakar Malami, says he has nothing to hide, expressing his readiness to appear before the Justice Ayo Salami-led presidential panel to testify in the hearing of a petition he wrote against the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu.
Magu is being investigated by the panel, following Malami’s petition to President Muhammadu Buhari.
It would be recalled that the suspended EFCC chairman wrote on Monday through his lawyer, Wahab Shittu, on the need for the panel to summon the AGF and ask him questions on the allegations in his petition.
Malami, who spoke on Wednesday as a guest on Arise TV promised to give the Salami panel his full cooperation when he appears before the panel.
He said: “So, if indeed the Ayo Salami panel invites Abubakar Malami as a person or the AGF in the person of Abubakar Malami for any testimony, for any clarification, for examination or cross-examination for that matter, Abubakar Malami will wholeheartedly, gladly, within the spirit and context of the rule of law, be there to testify, be there to be cross-examined, be there to be examined within the context of the rule of law.
Also, Malami has attributed Nigeria’s successes in the $10 million judgment against the country by P&ID as a product of collective institutional collaboration.
He said: “I wonder how one personality can claim victory associated with an institution. Neither the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation, that developed witnesses’ statements in support of the case that led to the victory, nor Abubakar Malami (SAN), (as Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice), can, in law and logic, claim an exclusively personalised the victory over a product of inter-governmental, inter-ministerial and multiple-agency collaborative venture.”
