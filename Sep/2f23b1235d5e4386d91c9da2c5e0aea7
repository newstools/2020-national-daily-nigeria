The Lagos State University, LASU, has released the schedule for re-opening of the university starting from September—for students in final year classes: 400, 500 and 600 levels.
The schedule released Friday, however, left out freshmen.
So students in terminal classes will resume on Monday, September 14, 2020 and they would have classes 9 am to 3 pm on week days only.
Also to return to classes on Monday, 14th September 2020 are the Masters and Ph.D. students. Their classes hold weekends.
Students from 200-Level to 500-Level are to resume November 9, 2020
Those of sandwich, part-time and diploma students would resume November 13, 2020 for weekend classes only at the institution’s Epe campus.
Safety protocols students and lecturers must observe include wearing compulsorily face masks, using sanitisers. They must wear their LASU I.D cards, too.
The school schedule said that all academic members of staff are to resume with students on Monday while only non-academic workers from CONUAS Level 12 and above–except those on essential duties—are expected on campus.
Recreational and commercial activities on campus will also be limited.
For freshmen, their lectures will go online until January 21.
