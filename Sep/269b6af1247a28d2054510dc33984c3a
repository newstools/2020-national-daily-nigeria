Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has reportedly agreed a five-year deal with City Football Group worth £623m that will see him spend three seasons at Manchester City before joining MLS side New York City FC.

This post was made by The Sun on twitter and Lionel Messi retweeted it.

Earlier on, Lionel Messi’s father and agent, Jorge Messi, landed in Barcelona after flying in overnight from Argentina. They are still in that meeting as at the time of this report.

This news comes amid multiple reports that Messi’s father is set to meet with the club’s board this week to discuss his son’s future.


On the Man City deal, expert believes half the fee will be add ons, a one-third of the total cost will be paid by the sponsors and Man City will recoup a lot of that in shirt sales. It’s a huge money but when you look at how deals are made it’s just clever contracts and not “that” much money actually spent.

Juventus was able to fund Cristiano Ronaldo’s sales by such sponsorship deals and jersey sales.

As the battle between Messi and Barca board continues many believes, “Messi stayed when our best players left, he stayed when Rosell & Bartomeu made scandal after scandal, he stayed despite carrying the team year in year out, he stayed despite humiliation after humiliation.”

No one can blame him for choosing what’s best for his career.
