President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday congratulated Tony Elumelu, Chairman, United Bank for Africa (UBA), on his enlistment in the Time 100 Most Influential People of 2020.
President Buhari in a statement commended Elumelu on his vision of Africapitalism, postulating that Africa’s private sector must play a leading role in the continent’s development through long-term investments, entrepreneurship, and regional connectivity. Buhari acknowledged that it was just a matter of time before such idea caught global attention.
President Buhari pointed out that “Elumelu’s commitment to the development of African youths, who he has given a voice and empowerment, investing $5,000 in 1,000 young entrepreneurs per year across 54 countries, pedestals him as a visionary, with milk of human kindness,” noting: “and such, among others, must have qualified him for the Time Hall of Fame.”
Buhari wished Elumelu greater successes on all fronts, recommending his strides to other high net worth people.
