Sheik Murtala Sokoto has warned President Muhammadu Buhari to change or he will pray to God to uproot the president from Aso Rock. He described those praising the president as liars and hypocrites too.
“The man they called ‘Sai Baba’ now cannot even go to Katsina. He (Buhari) knows the anger that will greet him if he goes to Katsina,” Sokoto said in a video on Sahara Reporters.
“The peak of stupidity is when these people say northerners have been given juicy positions, but those given these juicy positions have betrayed everyone.”
He said the poor were on the receiving end as they could no longer go to their farms due to the high level of insecurity.
“They said people should go to the farm but when you go to the farm you will be kidnapped. You (Buhari) said we should cultivate our farms in the North, go and see all over the North. An example is Katsina, go to Sokoto, Zamfara,” Sokoto said in his message addressed to northern youth.
“Because of cruelty and wickedness, they are saying we should be patient, but for how long shall we be more patient? Patience is something the prophet has given us conditions for. We have had enough of this oppressive government.”
He warned that though they are praying that Allah guide Buhari to make amends, to do better as a leader. “If he continues in his ways, we pray Allah to replace him with a better leader.”
President Buhari’s administration has been receiving knock more than ever since the beginning of his second term when insecurity and economic hardship have been on the rise.
