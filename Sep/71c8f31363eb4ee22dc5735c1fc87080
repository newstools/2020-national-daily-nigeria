The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the September 19 Edo State governorship elections, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has congratulated Captain Hosa Okunbo on his receiving a Forbes award for his outstanding leadership and for connecting Africa to the world.
 
The APC governorship candidate in a congratulatory letter stated: “I am elated that such a priceless honour is coming at a time like this. Your rare qualities, enterprise and humanness have received global recognition. “From you, I have learnt what it means to be a businessman, and I have learnt that money and popularity will mean nothing if I do not invest in people’s life. You lead quietly, you work quietly and in everything you are tireless with the strength of 10 men and the wisdom of a hundred more.”
 
Pastor Ize-Iyamu further expressed his pride in the award recognition, stating that while he and Edo State rejoice with the Captain, he should “Continue to soar higher with the strength of eagles, the majesty of lions and the humility of Moses.”
Captain Hosa Okunbo was presented with an award on Saturday, which he dedicated to the poor and downtrodden in Edo State.
 
The APC candidate further said that it is divine and auspicious that when those he had called your brothers had chosen to speak ill of him, the international platform has recognised his invaluable commitment to Africa and the world.
