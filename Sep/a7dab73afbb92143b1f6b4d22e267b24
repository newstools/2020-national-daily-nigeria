National Coordinator of Concerned Advocates for Good Governance (CAGG), Olusegun Bamgbose has revealed an alleged plot by some politicians in the Northern part of the country to thwart the presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu.
In a statement released on Monday, Bamgbose claimed that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the 2019 election, may strike a deal with President Muhammadu Buhari to edge out Bola Tinubu in the 2023 race.
Bamgbose, who is a senior legal practitioner, said the former Vice President is unstoppable, adding that though he (Atiku) may be aged, fortunately he is still healthy, firmly still in the race to contest for the last time.
“It’s very obvious that the power brokers from the North may not really trust Tinubu’s Presidency, not minding his support for Fulani oligarchy. The North always wants a candidate who will come out with his true colour, not necessarily one who is hiding his true character,” he noted.
“The North is viewing Tinubu as someone who may eventually rebel against the North, once he gets to the State House. Tinubu can’t be trusted with power, that’s the opinion of the majority of Northerners. Atiku Abubakar is on a daily basis strategizing on how to take over from Buhari come 2023.
“As a political strategist, he has foreseen that APC will ultimately not hand over the Presidential ticket to Tinubu come 2023. Based on this, he is seriously scheming to find his way back to APC. The only person that Atiku can’t influence with money is an Angel. Atiku will show his worth come 2021. He will be prepared to spend his last kobo to be the next President of Nigeria.
According to Bamgbose, Atiku is likely going to strike a deal with Buhari and power brokers to take over from Buhari, thereby edging out Tinubu.
