Special Adviser to incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, on Friday refuted the rumoured resignation of the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Dr. Tony Aziegbemi, saying that the information is fake news and a hoax.
Osagie, in a media interaction in Benin City, Edo State, described the rumour as “the fabrication of members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in their last minute and desperate efforts to save an unpopular candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, from quitting the gubernatorial race which the party is set to lose.”
“With just a week to the September 19 election, and worried by the lack of acceptance of its candidate, the APC has resorted to desperate and unconventional campaign tactics; fake news, deceit and falsehood, to attempt to sway Edo voters.
“For emphasis, the chairman of the PDP in Edo State, Dr. Tony Aziegbemi, has not resigned from the PDP. He is committed to leading the party to victory, come September 19, with the party’s standard bearer, Governor Godwin Obaseki.
“Edo people should ignore the shenanigans of the APC and come out en masse to reelect the PDP candidate on election day,” Osagie declared.
