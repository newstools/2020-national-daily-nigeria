An invisible group under the identity of Concerned Orhionmwon Indigenes and Lovers of Democracy in Edo State has raised alarm of allegation that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the September 19 governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and  an APC stalwart, Hon Etinosa Ogbeiwi, purportedly obtained military uniform to equip fake soldiers to operate on election day in the state. The group, accordingly, called on security operatives to be on red alert to forestall electoral violence during the governorship election.
 
The group in a statement anonymously signed by ‘Concerned Orhionmwon Indigenes and Lovers of Democracy’, declared: “It has come to the notice of Concerned Orhionmwon Indigenes and Lovers of Democracy that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Pastor Osagie Ize Iyamu, Hon Etinosa Ogbeiwi, have procured some military attires from one of the Nigerian Army barracks.
“The report is closely linked with one of the perfected plans to import fake soldiers which will be distributed across the polling units in Edo State. The fake military men will be positioned to cause Mayhem, violence that will disrupt the conduct of a credible poll in the September 19 Gubernatorial Election.”
The group, therefore, demanded that “all necessary agencies should be put on alert regarding this vital information.”
The group recalled that in an earlier leaked video, Pastor Osagie Ize Iyamu was seen addressing some youth who were referred to as the Lions and Tigers. “This report further confirms that these same persons are to be used in disguise as Police, soldiers, civil defence, etc.,” the group alleged; adding, “we are watching and monitoring closely.”
