Share this on WhatsAppThe candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Edo State governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, on Tuesday called off electioneering campaign at Usen, following a road crash that claimed lives of some APC members and supporters. The ghastly accident occurred at Oluku junction on Tuesday when a trailer ran into the travelling campaign entourage of top chieftains of the APC.
The Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, in a statement in Benin City, indicated that the party suspended the scheduled campaign for the day in order to honour the dead.
Accordingly, “on behalf of Pastor Ize-Iyamu and the APC,” Mayaki “condoled with the families of the victims,” saying “they were not alone in their grief.”
Mayaki disclosed that the APC pledged that the campaign organization would do everything within its powers to ameliorate their grief.
APC further assured families of the policemen involved in the fatal crash that Edo would never forget their supreme sacrifice.
The party called on all stakeholders to pray for the soul of dead, and against the recurrence of such tragedies.
