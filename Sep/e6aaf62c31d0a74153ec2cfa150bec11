Abba Ahmed had been moonstruck watching President Muhammadu Buhari’s daughter for only God knows how long—until Hanan announced her wedding. The secret admirer could not bear the loss, and opted for suicide Sept 4, the day Hanan wedded at Aso Rock.
The wedding went on as planned. Hanan married Turad Sha’aban, special adviser to Works Minister Babatunde Fashola and son of a former rep from Kaduna.
First Lady Aisha Buhari, on Instagram, later updated Nigerians on the success of the strictly private wedding.
About the suicide waiting to happen?
The Kano State Police Command, with the help of Force PRO Frank Mba, intervened and talked the 22-year-old out of his fatal daydream.
Ahmed, from the Bompai LGA of Kano, was neither a suitor nor ex to Hanan, a graduate of photography from Ravensbourne University, England.
In spite of the distance and apparent impossibility of such marriage, Ahmed’s crush got enflamed and he threatened to hang himself if he did not have Hanan.
If that was foolish, the love bird didn’t see it until the police intervened.
“We were able to invite Abba Ahmed to the police command. He was counselled by the Force PRO, DCP Frank Mba, as well as Kano CP, Habu Sani, and the command’s imam, SP Abdullkadir Haruna, via a virtual session,” Kano police command spokesperson Abdullahi Haruna briefed the Punch correspondent.
“At the end of which he rescinded his earlier decision to hang himself.”
Haruna added Ahmed also regretted his comments—that if he did not marry the President’s daughter, Hanan, he would hang himself.
“I realised that my intention is not healthy. Henceforth, I will never again attempt to find myself in such a situation,” Ahmed himself was quoted as saying.
