Incumbent governor of Ondo state and governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the October governorship election, Rotimi Akeredolu has again thrown another jibe at his predecessor in Office, Olusegun Mimiko.
In the latest exchange of words, Akeredolu, who is running against his former deputy, Aayi Agboola, now of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), described both his estranged deputy and his predecessor as having traits of betrayer.
While reacting to a question on Arise TV, Akeredolu alleged that Mimiko is dead politically, and that he now needed Agboola’s money for political resurrection.
“Does it affect me, does it make me nervous? The answer is no. I am confident of my victory. Who are these people? They were never my allies.
“I ran against him (Mimiko) in 2012. I ran against Jegede in 2016 with Mimiko supporting him. I have treated him fairly. Mimiko has his own trait, if Agboola with all he did finds solace in Mimiko, it is because they have the same trait, they are people prone to betrayer.
“Mimiko is not a political force anywhere, he left the governor’s office, and tried the senate, and he did not win. He did not even win his local government, he is a spent force.
“He is dead politically, he is probably looking for someone to resurrect him, and maybe Agboola has some money to spend on him. I know agbola has some money to waste. Mimiko is a nobody anymore. You guys are the ones keeping them alive.”
He also accused Agboola and his wife of taking contracts from the state.
