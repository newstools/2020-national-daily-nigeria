The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming September 19 poll and incumbent governor of Edo state, Godwin Obaseki has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of churning out lies and propaganda in its bid to get the September 19 poll cancelled or postponed.
The Special Adviser to Governor Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, stated this while reacting to the All Progressives Congress (APC) allegations that suspected thugs are being warehoused at the government house.
It would be recalled that the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, had alleged that buses loaded with strange faces were spotted entering Benin City, capital of Edo State.
According to him, while their mission may not be immediately clear, intelligence reports indicate that the manner and consistency of entry, the direction of the buses and the all-male occupants, justify reports that Governor Obaseki is recruiting thugs and on a mission to set Edo State ablaze with violence.
In reaction, Osagie, declared as false, allegation by the APC that thugs were being ferried into the Government House, insisting that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, is no match for Governor Obaseki.
Osagie, who made the declaration in a statement issued in Benin City, said: “Convinced that its candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, is no match for Governor Obaseki, APC is churning out lies and propaganda in its bid to get the September 19 poll cancelled or postponed.”
