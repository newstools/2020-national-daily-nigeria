For their roles in the last three staggered election between 2019 and now, three governors and one former national chairman have been banned from entering the US.
All of them, members of the APC, were sanctioned for their roles in undermining democracy between February 2019 during the presidential election, to the 2019 Kogi and Kno election.
So Govs Yahaya Bello, Nasir el-Rufai,  and Abdullahi Ganduje ca no longer enter the US.
Their party’s former national chairman Adams Oshiomhole is also on the list.
According to US officials, more Nigerian politicians may be included on the visa ban list after the Edo governorship election if they are involved in electoral malpractice.
A statement by spokesperson for the Department of State, Morgan Ortagus, on Monday said those issued visa bans received the sanction for undermining democracy in Nigeria.
“In July 2019, we announced the imposition of visa restrictions on Nigerians who undermined the February and March 2019 elections. Today, the Secretary of State is imposing additional visa restrictions on individuals for their actions surrounding the November 2019 Kogi and Bayelsa states elections and in the run up to the September and October 2020 Edo and Ondo states elections.
“These individuals have so far operated with impunity at the expense of the Nigerian people and have undermined democratic principles.
“The Department of State emphasises that the actions announced today are specific to certain individuals and not directed at the Nigerian people. This decision reflects the Department of State’s commitment to working with the Nigerian Government to realise its expressed commitment to end corruption and strengthen democracy, accountability, and respect for human rights.”
Kogi Gov Bello has written to the US official to challenge the ban, describing the decision as unjust.
