Edo Gov Godwin Obaseki is leaving no one behind as he doles out campaign promises to different categories of voters, including the idle kids in advanced fee fraud Nigerians notoriously refer to as Yahoo-Yahoo.
“I will train young boys who do ‘Yahoo’ to work in our technology park. We will train them and ensure they become more useful to society,” the PDP said at a rally in Ikpoba Okha LGA of Edo on Friday.
According to him, he has planned for a technology park to train the repentant ones among the internet fraudsters on something better than advance fee fraud:  advanced information and communication technology and other vocational skills.
The second-term promise also include channelling of 50MW of energy from the Independent Power Plant at Ihovbor near Azura, in the Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area, to the remodelled technical college through Ikpoba Hill.
He said this will help to put idle hands to work and create employment opportunities for youths in the state.
About 14 million Nigerian youth currently wallow in unemployment, according to the Nigeria Bureau Statistics.
