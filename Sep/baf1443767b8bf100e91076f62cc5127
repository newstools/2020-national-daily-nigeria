Mohammadu Buhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, has approved the release of 30, 000 tons of maize to animal feed producers to cushion the hike in food prices across the nation.

He took to his verified twitter account to make the announcement. In a tweet thread, the president said, “To ease the current high cos t of poultry production, I have approved the release of 30,000 tons of maize from the national reserves, to animal feed producers.

“We are very mindful of the challenge of high food prices, at a time when the economy is already in a slowdown caused by the global coronavirus situation, and are doing everything in our power to bring down the prices of food items across the country.

“Let me assure Nigerians that this situation of spiraling food prices will be a transient one.

“We are also engaging with food producers associations and groups to tackle the issue of exploitative behaviour by middlemen and other actors, which is one of the factors responsible for the high food prices being experienced.”
