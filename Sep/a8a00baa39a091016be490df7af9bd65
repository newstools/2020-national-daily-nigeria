The national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, at the weekend visited former Governor Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko of Sokoto State, to condole him on the death of his daughter, Sadiya Aliyu Wamakko, in Sokoto State.
The former Lagos State Governor encouraged Wamakko to take solace in the Almighty God and accept the death of his daughter as the will of Allah.
Tinubu prayed Allah to grant other members of the family the longevity denied the deceased daughter.
Tinubu, during the condolence visit, advocated the need for national unity and cohesion, which he considered imperative to national development.
Tinubu had declared: “There’s nothing we can achieve without unity, so, we have to be united to develop our country. The blood that runs in your veins is the same blood that runs in my vein.
“Sadia who has just passed on did not dictate that Wamakko will be his father, it is God’s gift and it is the Almighty Allah who decides. So, if you know that you have no control over it, whether I’m a Yoruba or Hausa or Igbo man, the essence of our life is that we are Nigerians and we should always take that first in everything we do.”
It was gathered that Sadiya Aliyu Wamakko died last Thursday at the Usmanu Danfodio Teaching Hospital from complications arising from childbirth.
