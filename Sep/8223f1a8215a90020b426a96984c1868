The Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi, candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, has placed Governor Rotimi Akeredolu under siege since his defection from  the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and subsequently to the ZLP where he picked the ticket for the October governorship election in Ondo. The deputy governor appears to have become nightmare to Governor Akeredolu since his defection, complicating the impeachment processes to weaken the governor from removing him from office.
Governor Akeredolu, according to sources from the state, has been unsettled over the defection of Deputy Governor Ajayi and the inability to remove him from office. The deputy governor’s political prowess appears intimidating to the governor who has continued to seek means to frustrate the deputy governor both in the Government House, Akure, and the governorship race in the state.
Apparently, Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi on Tuesday raised alarm that his campaign plans are being frustrated by Governor Akeredolu. The deputy governor said the governor declined to approve venue for his kickoff campaign in Akure. The Deputy Governor said that despite the readiness of his party, ZLP to pay the amount for hiring the campaign venue Akure, refused approval for ZLP. Deputy Governor Ajayi accused Governor Akeredolu of directing the agency not to grant permit to the ZLP candidate.
The Special Adviser on Media to the Governor, Allen Sowore, in a statement protested that the perceived action of the governor as undemocratic and condemnable.
The Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, was said to have refuted the allegation, explaining that the park (venue) was not in the care of the state government but managed by a consultant. The Commissioner said the allegation is sheer blackmail and ridiculous.
