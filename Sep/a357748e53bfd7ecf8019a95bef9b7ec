Manchester United have not hidden their desire to make Jadon Sancho their top transfer target.
Disappointingly, the Red Devils attempt to bring the England sensation to Old Trafford has been met with series of challenges ranging from the valuation of the former Manchester City academy player to his personal terms as well as the agency fee.
While Borussia Dortmund have valued their prolific winger at over £100 million, United are reportedly only willing to pay £80 million for the 20-year-old due to present financial climate as occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Budesliga giants have gone ahead to declare that Sancho is remaining at the Signal Iduna Park after United fell short of striking a transfer for the England international before the BVB August 10 self-designed transfer deadline for their winger.
Meanwhile, Manchester United fans could finally have reasons to celebrate the much awaited arrival of their dream player if the report reaching National Daily is to be trusted.
It has been suggested that United have reportedly come to an agreement with Borussia Dortmund over negotiations for Jadon Sancho.
National Daily gathered from Bleacher Report, that the two clubs have finally agreed to adopt a ‘respectful manner’ in talks after months of speculation over the 20-year-old’s future.
The report further stated that the Old Trafford club were pained by the manner the details of their discussions at the initial stages were leaked to the public.
Though United have been unable to strike a deal for Sancho, but it is understood that the Premier League giants could be reaching a more feasible stage of negotiations.
