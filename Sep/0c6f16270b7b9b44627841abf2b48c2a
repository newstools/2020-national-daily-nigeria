Share this on WhatsAppPDP’s national chairman Uche Secondus is, by all standards, a second-rate politician under whose nose the opposition party is self-destructing.
An angry party leader in Ekiti stated this in an ode he wrote to Secondus on Friday.
Segun Adewumi, a former deputy speaker of the state assembly, described the crises plaguing the party across the nation as a tell-all sign that the opposition is dead and buried by the party chairman and his men who he said are tax collectors and morticians.
“We have a chairman that lacks political stature, academic acumen, intellectual capacity and clout to manage a political party of PDP caliber,’ he wrote in the letter.
“Can you compare Uche Secondus with Solomon Lar, Audu Ogbe or Kawu Baraje terms of clout, carriage, crisis and human management?”
As of now, Kaduna, Ekiti, Cross Rivers, Plateau, Ogun, Ondo, Bayelsa, and Osun are among the state chapters tottering on the brink of disintegration.
“The goodwill and political fortunes of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) earned over the last 20 years has been squandered and wasted by the present kindergarten NWC on the altar of genuflecting and selfish interests,” he said.
Ekiti, among the state chapters, has be split down the middle following the superiority war between ex-Gov. Ayo Fayose and Sen. Biodun Olujimi. Both, ex-party leader and most ranking politician in Ekiti PDP respectively, are fighting over the party’s state structure.
The party NWC has been watching the conflict from the Wadata plaza with nothing concrete as an effort to save the party.PDP
