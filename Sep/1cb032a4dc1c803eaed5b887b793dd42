The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has issued serious warnings to domestic airline operators in the country, threatening to stop domestic flights in the country over breach of COVID-19 safety protocols.
In a letter addressed to local airlines, NCAA said it has observed that some airlines are breaching the protocol put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The regulatory agency, therefore, warned defaulters to desist or face “severe penalties” including “cancellation of approval to resume domestic operations”.
NCAA made it clear that the resumption of domestic operations was based on compliance with protocols put in place by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
“Approvals for resumption of domestic operations are predicated on compliance with the above protocol. This is a warning to all domestic operators who are not in compliance to desist from such acts immediately.
“The continued non-compliance with the COVID-19 protocol will attract severe penalties up to and including cancellation of approval to resume domestic operations. Please be guided accordingly,” the letter read in part.
