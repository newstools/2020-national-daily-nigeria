The Chief Press Secretary to the Wife of the Governor of Edo State, Peter Okonkwo, in a statement in Benin City acknowledged a press statement of the APC issued by John Mayaki alleging that the wife of the incumbent governor, Betsy Obaseki, ordered the police to stop a free medical outreach organised by the wife of the APC candidate in Uromi.
The CPS to the Edo First narrated  Mrs. Betsy Obaseki is busy with the Women Wing of the PDP Campaign Committee and she has been engaged in series of meetings and mobilisation for the September 19 governorship election as could be seen with the success of the campaign in Esan Land. He maintained that the Governor’s wife does not run the Police force, arguing: “so, this accusation is totally frivolous.”
He was of the view that the APC is intimidated by the massive support the Esan people  have given to the PDP government and their resolve to return Governor Obaseki for second term; declaring: “so, they are now making up excuses not to continue their campaign.”
