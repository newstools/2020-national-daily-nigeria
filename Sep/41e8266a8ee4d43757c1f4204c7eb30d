Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, (OYC), an Igbo socio-cultural organization has given reasons why the Peoples Democratic Party should jettison any plan to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the North.
In a statement signed by its President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro on Monday, the group insisted that the nation’s presidency should be ceded to the Igbo nation in Southern Nigeria in 2023 for its immense contributions in deepening democracy as well in the country.
According to the group, Saturday’s triumph of the Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party over Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress was affirmative evidence that PDP should jettison any plan to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the North.
The Igbo youth body also issued seven days ultimatum notice to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to state its position on the several clamours by the Igbo nation to take its shot in 2023.
OYC disclosed that the ultimatum takes effect from Monday (today), saying further that at the expiration of ultimatum, there would be inevitable aggressive orientation of Igbos to seek for alternative political solutions if PDP continues to assault on Igbo intelligence as cows that should be milked to death, especially during elections.
According to the Ohanaeze release which partly stated, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC, is apprehensive about the obvious silence of the national leadership of PDP to speak on the allegations of dumping Igbo presidency for a northern candidate in 2023. PDP leadership should speak out either in support or against 2023 Igbo presidential project, and failure to address this issue at the expiration of the ultimatum, there will be severe political consequences and damages for PDP through aggressive media enlightenment in the seven Igbo-speaking States, including Anioma in Delta and Rivers States, on why igbos should not vote PDP in the future elections starting from Anambra 2021.
“OYC had uncovered shocking facts about the well-scripted plots to use the Biafra agitation, as a ploy to thwart the 2023 Igbo presidential project through agents of PDP led by a former Governor from South East zone, and would subsequently use it as a bargaining weapon to outwit his closest rival, who is a sitting governor from Niger Delta region for the 2023 PDP Vice presidential slot”.
