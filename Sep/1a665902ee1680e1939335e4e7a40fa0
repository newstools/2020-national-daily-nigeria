The fans at the Emirates have welcomed the decision of their captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to extend his stay with Arsenal.
National Daily can confirm that the Gabonese international who has taken the least amount of time to reach 50 goals with the north London club has signed a new three-year contract with Arsenal.
Aubameyang’s deal had been due to expire at the end of the season, but he has now ended speculation by extending his stay at the Emirates.
Meanwhile, Mikel Areteta has remained confident that his captain who scored in their opening-day 3-0 win over Fulham on Saturday will remain with the club when he hinted on the new contract being close after the match.
“Signing for this special club was never in doubt,” Aubameyang said. “It’s thanks to our fans, my team-mates, my family and everybody at this club that I feel like I belong here.
“I believe in Arsenal. We can achieve big things together. We have something exciting here and I believe the best is to come for Arsenal.”
This development will definitely come as a big relief for the Gunners fans who have been left in a frenzy state owing to the speculations on whether their talismanic captain will depart or remain at the Emirates.
And for Arteta: “It was important for Pierre-Emerick to stay with us. He’s a superb player with an incredible mentality. Being the player to have taken the least amount of time to reach 50 goals with this club tells you everything you need to know about him and his way of working.
