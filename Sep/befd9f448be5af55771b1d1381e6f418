The All Progressives Congress (APC) has gone into early celebration of the yet to be concluded Saturday governorship election in Edo State. APC on Saturday afternoon disclosed that panic has befallen the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) camp in Edo State as they have reportedly started to perceive defeat at the polls.
 
APC in a statement by Prince John Mayaki, Chairman, Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, indicated that sources close to the party, who say that governor Obaseki, PDP candidate, furious with some of his thugs for not wreaking violence despite the presence of armed forces, has activated PLAB B for the elections.
 
APC alleged: According to one source, “Obaseki was not joking when he said ‘second term is non-negotiable.’ You know Rivers State governor (Wike) has connection into the judiciary, along with Peter Odili. They already know they won’t win so they are planning how they will get the courts to turn the election on its head.
 
“He has already posted cameramen and different people to gather materials which he will use as evidence. But he has also gathered people that are very good at video editing so that they can doctor the evidence.”
 
The statement further reads: “The only way to counter that is if pressmen from media houses can be there. Otherwise, they will edit the videos and tender it as evidence at the tribunal.”
 
The APC claimed that the source also disclosed that “Edo Deputy Governor, Phillip Shaibu, who was protested against by the people of Jattu in Etsako West on Thursday, had instructed some spies not to decamp from the APC as they would serve as witnesses when the time came. They plan to suborn the party by giving false testimonies.”
