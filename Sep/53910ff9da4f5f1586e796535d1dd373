The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government in Edo State has called on the Nigeria Police, the Department for State Services (DSS), the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), and other security agencies in Nigeria to invite a Benin billionaire, Captain Hosa Okunbo, for questioning over alleged recruitment of 3,000 militants from the Niger Delta into Edo State. The Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy to the Edo State Governor, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, accordingly, demanded that the security operative should invite Captain Hosa Okunbo to reveal the identities of “his 3000 Niger Delta militants, who deployed to overrun Edo State on his prompting”.
Osagie declared: “Okunbo, who is the sponsor of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the September 19 gubernatorial election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, threatened in a widely published newspaper interview he granted journalists in Abuja, that if his 3000 militants in the Niger Delta region get the nod from him, they would overrun Benin City.”
Osagie pointed out: “He said he has 3000 youths he is partnering within the Niger Delta region.”
He, therefore, protested: “What kind of partnership does he have with these militants? How did he become their Commander-In-Chief? Why is it that we are only at peace in Benin City simply because he has decided to be merciful by not giving the go-ahead to them to invade Edo? Is overrunning a state like Edo part of their job description in the so-called partnership he has with these militants? How sure are we that he will not change his mind on or before the election and order his thugs to come into Benin and do the damage?”
