Alhaji Sahabi Umar declared: “We, the Hausa people, have no choice but to vote for him massively. We are strongly supporting him and will vote for him and his deputy, Rt.Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, who we have adopted as our brother.
“Shaibu has given employment opportunities to many sons and daughters of Hausaland. He does not discriminate, while he was in Edo House of Assembly and House of Representatives, he employed Muslims that are Hausas.
“The governor has done well; his administration is good to everyone in the state. He accommodated us. All the northerners are very okay and satisfied with his governance style. “We are full residents of this place. We got married here and all have our voters’ cards.
“We have children here and they school here in Edo. His administration has ensured that our children do well in school. This is why we are supporting him with our votes.”
Chairman of Edo State PDP Campaign Council, Dan Orbih, acknowledged the spreading of infrastructural development across the state by incumbent Governor Obaseki.
Orbih stated: “Look at how the governor has remodeled the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, he upgraded it to international standard and he also built a mini-stadium in Western Boys High School, the venue of this campaign.”
