After casting his vote at Polling Unit 19, ward 4, Oredo LGA, Edo Gov. Godwin Obaseki expressed dissatisfaction the way the guber election voting was progressing.
According to the PDP candidate, INEC should have done better than that.
“I waited for one and half hour on the queue before exercising my franchise, it’s a bit disappointing,” he said after voting.
“Giving that this is a sole day election, I expected better planning for this election. Card readers were very slow and that’s the situation everywhere.”
The delay he experienced was due to the card reader responding slowly.
For his special adviser Crusoe Osagie, the card reader wasn’t the problem.
Osagie believed was manipulation in areas where Obaseki is popular.
“Voters are being disenfranchised and we are constrained to say that this is sabotage,” he said.
“Specifically, in Oredo Ward 1, Unit 20 and other places where the Governor is clearly popular, the card readers are not working.
He challenged INEC to prove to voters that it can conduct a credible election in Edo.
