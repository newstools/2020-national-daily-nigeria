The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says it has uncovered another plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to scuttle the September 19 governorship election in Edo state through frivolous court injunctions.
Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan who raised the alarm while addressing journalists at the party’s headquarters in Abuja, said APC has perfected plans to use the judiciary to halt the election.
He alleged that the APC has concluded plans to file a suit before the High Court in Benin to stop the election.
According to him, some people want to use frivolous lawsuits to scuttle the September 19 Edo State governorship election, following APC’s realization that there’s no way it could win in the election.
He said it was revealed to PDP that some interests who are masquerading through certain political groups are seeking to blackmail the judiciary and stampede the court to violate the clear provisions of the Electoral Act and illegally halt the election.
Ologbondiyan added that the aim of APC is to use the political groups to drag in the judiciary, trigger constitutional crises in Edo State, the Niger Delta region and the nation at large and blame it on the court.
The PDP chieftain also called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to investigate the cause of the fire outbreak in its Ondo State office in Akure, stating that it was part of the process to discredit and rig the October 10 governorship election in the state.
