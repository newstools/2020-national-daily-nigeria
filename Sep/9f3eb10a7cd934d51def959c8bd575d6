Education Minister Adamu Adamu has been admitted into a hospital in Berlin, Germany, where he’s treating an undisclosed ailment.
This is the third time Adamu would be flown abroad for medical treatment, according to Sahara Reporters.
He’s said to be treating a kidney-related condition.
The last time the minster discharged his duty was at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria in March, when he ordered all educational institutions closed.
Two prominent members of President Muhammadu’s power circle—CoS Abba Kyari and Isa Funtua—fell sick and died while the pandemic raged and many countries were on lockdown.
