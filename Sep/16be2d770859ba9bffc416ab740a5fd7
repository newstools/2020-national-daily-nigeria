Protesters accompanied a prominent leader in Southern Kaduna and a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, as he reported  at the Department of State Services (DSS) in Jos, Plateau State, for the third time on Monday to honour the invitation from the security agency.
The DSS had invited Mailafia for interrogations after he leaked some alleged secrets of the killings by Fulani in Southern Kaduna. The DSS felt the utterances of Mailafia on live radio threaten national security.
Some stakeholders in the Nigerian project were of the view that the DSS deliberately shifted from the substantive issues raised by Mailafia to descending the leader from Southern Kaduna and intimidate him into recanting his words than investigating to unravel the realities of the security breakdown in Southern Kaduna. Apparently, DSS chided   Mailafia for perceived fake news towards creating “unnecessary tension” in the country.
Mailafia had alleged that the killer Fulani are armed by some political leaders, further alleging that a governor in the north is the commander of the Boko Haram terrorists.
Mailafia at the DSS office, Jos, explained that he honoured the invitation to prove he is a law-abiding citizen, as well as to clarify whatever issues the security operatives have with him.
Mailafia, appearing at the DSS office on Monday, met a crowd of sympathizers or loyalists displaying placards with several inscriptions demanding an end to the interrogation and intimidation of their leader by the Service. They protesters further demand his immediate release without delay.
Meanwhile, Mailafia is in court with the DSS, challenging his repetitive invitation by the security service which he protested constituted intimidation, harassment, persecution, and witch hunt.
