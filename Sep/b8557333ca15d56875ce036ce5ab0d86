The LFP Disciplinary Committee in France has revealed punishment for the players involved in the mass brawl that overshadowed Paris Saint-Germain’s clash with Marseille last weekend.

Neymar was one of five players sent off after a fight broke out between Argentine pair Dario Benedetto and Leandro Paredes and then extended to other players at the end of PSG’s shock 1-0 defeat to Marseille last Sunday.

On Wednesday, September, 16, the French football governing announced PSG full-back, Layvin Kurzawa, has been slapped with a six-game ban for his role after he kicked Jordan Amavi.

Neymar accused Gonzalez of racially abusing him during the clash. He claimed Alvaro called him a ‘monkey son of a b****’, but Gonzalez has since denied the claims.

The LFP will investigate those allegations against the Spanish defender, and also look into claims filed by Marseille that PSG star Angel Di Maria spat at Gonzalez.
