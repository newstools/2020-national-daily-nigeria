Ediale also pens an InstaLetter about the situation here:

Dear Young men,

When you see a woman like this run.

They are here. Easy to know.

They are everywhere. Always ready to fight.

They insult your grandma over a post.

They are quick to use the Block Button.

And that’s the fairest part of their bad.

They are easily pissed. And when they are vexed, they have no control. All hell is loose.

Run. Run. Run.

For your life. For her life. For passersby’s lives as well. Even for your neighbour’s lives.

There’s no amount of wrong that should make a woman go this lenght.

Cheating?

“No be today na”

Even if he is cheating with your mum.

Walk away.

Unless he killed someone you know.

And in which case you should simply go and report to the appropriate crime fighter.

But why?

Why do relationship peeps of nowadays just want to destroy over some disagreement.

At times, I understand why. Yet I still feel it’s totally unecessary.

Walk away. Stay away. Or as usual, use your Social Block Button.

Like I said that is fair enough.

This is still better than cutting of his brobro.

Way better than chopping off his glorious organ.

“Abeg jeje o’

Your Running spotter,
Ediale

PS: 3 things I can’t stand in a lady:
— Violence (Even that violent sex thing, I know do)
— Fetishness (One baba say…)
— All-My-Friends-Are-Boys (Really? Pele o, Sister Boys 2 Men)
