There goes the lamentation from citizens in northern Nigeria; their leaders accumulate too much political powers but fail to promote peace and development in the north. They use the Nigerian state to acquire both international and domestic powers without promoting the interests of their people. Boko Haram terrorism, banditry, killer herdsmen, have developed more than the economy of the north co-existing with massive accumulation of political powers by elite in the north. The people are crying out loud for peace!
Thus, they presented list of certain significant political powers controlled by northern elite yet no peace.
The people lament:

North has Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations – from Gombe State
North has President of Nigeria – from Katsina State
North has Secretary General of OPEC – from Adamawa State
North has President of the UN General Assembly – from Kebbi State
North has Secretary to the Government of the Federation – Adamawa State
North has Senate President of the Nigerian National Assembly – Yobe State
North has Chief Justice of Nigeria – Bauchi State
North has President of the Court of Appeal – Bauchi State
North has Inspector General of Police – Nasarawa State
North has Chief of Army Staff – Borno State
North has National Security Adviser – Borno State
North has Chief of Air Staff – Bauchi State
North has chief of Staff to the President – Kwara State
North has EFCC Chairman – Borno State
North has DG of FERMA – Borno State
North has Panel Chairman of National Intelligence Agency – Borno State
North has GMD of NNPC – Borno State
North has DG of Nigerian Ports Authority – Kaduna State
North has CG of Customs – Kaduna State
North has 57 senators in the National Assembly
North has 19 governors

The people are simply demanding the use of these powers to promote peace, development, and their welfare; some say they are not feeling the impact those in power in the north.  There are several others not included in the list.
