The former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, on Sunday congratulated incumbent Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on his victory in the governorship election in the state. Saraki celebrated that Governor Obaseki sacked Adams Oshiomhole as national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and subsequently retired him from politics after the Edo State governorship election.

Saraki on his social media page declared:
“Obaseki removed Adams Oshiomhole as APC chairman.
“Obaseki has retired Adams Oshiomhole politically.
“Obaseki made Tinubu politically irrelevant.
“Obaseki is the Jagaban of Edo politics.
