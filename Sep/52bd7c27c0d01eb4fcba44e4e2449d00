A Christian cleric has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari wants to take over the funds of churches through the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA, 2020.
The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, who disclosed in a statement called on President Muhammadu Buhari to perish the thought of controlling the church.
He also claimed that Buhari wants to take over church treasury after allegedly selling Nigeria to China, warning the president to perish such a thought as it could only control the “church in his dreams.”
He said, “Didn’t I say it on April 22 this year that President Buhari and others in the APC have sold Nigeria to China?
“We all saw what happened thereafter; the Chinese have taken over every nook and cranny of this country. If you borrow money from them and you are unable to pay, they take over your nation.
“Nigerians should ask them what they used the money they borrowed for. Did they use it on poor electricity supply or economy or roads?
“They have emptied the nation’s treasury, re-looted all loot and all our savings have disappeared. Now, they think they can get money from the church.
“They want to reap what they have not worked for. Somebody should tell them that they can only control the church in their dreams. We are answerable to God, we are not answerable to Buhari or anybody.
“In as much as God gives me strength, I shall continue to say the truth, no matter whose ox is gored.”
