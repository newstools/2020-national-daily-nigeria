As Ondo guber election draws near, the camp of APC’s candidate Gov. Rotimi Akeredou is diminishing even if by one while his ZLP rival and Deputy Gov. Agboola Ajayi is welcoming them in.
Sept. 18, an aide to Akeredolu submitted his resignation letter, stating categorically he’s joining the deputy governor to defeat the governor.
Andrew Ogunsakin, the senior special assistant on politics (South)  said his decision is irrevocable.
“The call of my constituents on me to join the train to actualize a common aspiration different from what is offered by your government and your party stands at the root of my decision to quit at this point. Being an appointee, this will necessarily conflict with the performance of my duty to you hence my resignation,” said.
“I thank your Excellency for the opportunity afforded me to serve the good people of Ondo State as SSA, for the period I was in office.
“Once again, Sir, please accept my appreciation and very high regard”
Akeredolu and Agboola fell apart long ago, and the two have been showing their might in moves and counter moves to survive until the guber election coming in 23 days’ time.
