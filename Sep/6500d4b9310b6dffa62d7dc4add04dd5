There appeared to be confusion at the Monday sitting of the Presidential Panel of Inquiry investigating corruption allegations against former Acting Chairman of the Economic and Finical Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, when chairman of the panel, Justice Ayo Salami, ordered security aides to walk two lawyers, Prof Zainab Duke Abiola and Mr. Aliyu Lemu, defending Magu out of the sitting.
Magu is being investigated by the Salami panel on allegations of mismanagement of recovered assets and abuse of office.
It was gathered that the lead counsel, Wahab Shittu, who has been appearing for Magu, had at about 11:50am taken the stage to introduce other defence counsels in Magu’s legal team. Justice Salami was alleged to have interrupted Shittu, saying that Shittu alone would be permitted to defend Magu.
Salami, a former President of the Court of Appeal, was alleged to have ordered the security operatives to walk the lawyers out of the venue.
