Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Tuesday congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on the completion of the Itakpe-Ajaokuta Standard Gauge rail line project. He stated: “It is quite fortuitous that few days to our 60th independence anniversary as a nation, our President has achieved this feat of completing this critical infrastructure required for our development as a country and in our region.”
The Edo governor subsequently appealed to the President to extend the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge to link the Benin Industrial Park in Ologbo, Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area, Edo State.
Governor Obaseki  in his goodwill message, commended President Buhari for the virtual inauguration of the Goodluck Jonathan Railway Complex in Agbor (Owa-Oyibu), Delta State.
The Governor explained that an extension of the railway line to Ologbo would help in the movement of goods from the industrial park, adding that the railway line would be a critical infrastructure to easily convey products from the Benin Industrial Park, when completed, to the northern part of the country.
“We are excited in the state. As a government, we are going to be working with you to ensure that we utilise the infrastructure we are privileged to have. We appeal to the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi to work with us as a state to extend the rail line to the Industrial Park which we have commenced in the state to enable us to freight the things we produce to the northern part of the country,” Obaseki said.
