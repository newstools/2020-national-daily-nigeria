The Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, on Thursday ordered the restriction of vehicular movement from 11.59pm on Friday – 6.00pm on Saturday towards efforts at ensuring public order and safety, during the Edo gubernatorial election on Saturday.
The IGP explained that the restriction order will be enforced to prevent the free flow, circulation and use of illicit arms and hard drugs; also checkmate the movement of political thugs, touts and other criminally-minded individuals, especially, from contiguous states from hijacking and disrupting the electoral processes.
The IG encouraged citizens to go out en-masse on the election day and vote, assuring that the Police and other security agencies have been sufficiently mobilized to provide safe, secure and conducive environment for the election.
Regretting the inconveniences the restriction order may cause Nigerians, the IGP enjoined citizens to see the restriction as part of necessary sacrifices towards the enthronement of democracy. He, however, warned that the Force will not sit idly-by and watch citizens who may want to engage in any criminal act – violent and destructive acts, snatching of ballot boxes, vote buying, vote selling, hate speeches, and other act(s) capable of compromising the electoral processes.
