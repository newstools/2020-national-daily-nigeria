Former presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to the increment in electricity tariff and the pump price of premium motor spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol.
Recall that the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) had approved the Multi Year Tariff Order 2020, and began the implementation by September 1.
According to electricity distribution companies, the new rates are categorised by the number of hours the customers are supplied electricity.
According to them, rates charged are fair to customers and will guarantee full recovery of efficient cost of operations and reasonable rate of return on capital invested by the power firms.
They said the new rates will provide a path for transition to full service-based cost-reflective tariffs by July 20
Similarly, the pump price of premium motor spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol has been increased to N151.56 per litre with effect from September 2, 2020.
This was disclosed in an internal memo by the Pipeline and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), Ibadan depot, to all the stakeholders on September 2, 2020, and signed by the Depot Manager, D.O. Abalaka.
But reacting on Thursday, the former Vice President slammed the federal government, saying Nigerians need stimulus and not increment of electricity tariff.
In a tweet, the former Vice President described the increment as ill-advised.
 
“I reject the increased electricity tariffs. Coming out of the lockdown, Nigerians need a stimulus, not an impetuous disregard for the challenges they face.
“Many Nigerians have not earned an income for months, due to no fault of theirs. This increase is ill-timed and ill-advised,” Atiku tweeted.
