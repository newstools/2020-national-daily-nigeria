This was contained in a press statement by Eric Ojiekwe, Director Press and Public Relations of the Ministry.

The National President, Public Transport Owners of Nigeria Association (PTONA), Engr. Isaac Uhunwagho who led the delegation on the visit to the Honourable Minister of State for Transportation, Sen. Gbemisola Saraki, stated that their visit is in respect challenges being faced by the body and also to appreciate her efforts towards the chalenges PTONA has being facing since February, 2020 and the cooperation and protection which the Ministry is now ready to provide for public transportation in Nigeria. The President said that with this, “our future in the ‘one chance’ business is now encouraging.
Also, Engr. Isaac pleaded for COVID-19 financial palliatives for her members to prevent their businesses from folding up. The President, PTONA clarifying on the need for this disclosed that PTONA members felt the impact of the lockdown the most as their branded buses could not operate due to the ban on interstate travel. The general motor parks he said did not comply with the ban as their parks became a safe haven for flouting the ban and as a result enjoyed black market transportation boom.
He further lamented that despite PTONA members being the major investors in the transportation sector, it is ironical that their companies are the prime target for state and local government authorities who impose taxes, levies and other ridiculous conditions on their members while according to him, they leave the filthy general motor parks and target us. These challenges among others necessitated the visit on the Honourable Minister and hoped their pleas would be looked into.
