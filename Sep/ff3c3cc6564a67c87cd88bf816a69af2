Some Nigerians have become worried over negative development statistics the country has fallen into in the six years of the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). A notable public commentator, Remo Omokri, on his twitter handle @renoomokri, listed a few global statistics on the deplorable situation in Nigeria.
Omokri @renoomokri, wrote: “Under General @MBuhari, Nigeria became:

World capital for extreme poverty, June 25, 2018
World capital for out of School kids, July 25, 2017
World capital for under 5 deaths, September 8, 2020
Most dangerous place on Earth to be a Christian, January 14, 2016.”

These are, however, not including internal statistics of the unemployed and job losses, fallen standard of education, rocketing inflation, low value of Naira, etc.
