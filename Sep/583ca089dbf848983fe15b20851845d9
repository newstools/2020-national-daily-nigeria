Phillip Shaibu, Edo State Deputy Governor, has spoken on his alleged arrest by security agencies, threatening that people of Edo state would resist any attempt to arrest or intimidate him ahead of the guber poll in the state.
In a statement by his spokesman, Benjamin Atu, Shaibu accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) former national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole of plotting to use federal might to intimidate him and Governor Godwin Obaseki.
Shaibu said it is untrue that he was caught with illegal arms.
Atu noted: “The Deputy Governor has not been arrested but we are aware of an ongoing plan to arrest him over unfounded lies so that Oshiomhole and his cohorts will have the freedom to rig the Edo North Senatorial district election.”
“I want to assure that Comrade Philip Shaibu can’t be arrested because the People of Edo State will resist it. Oshiomhole is planning to create unrest in the State on Election Day by his attempt to use the DSS to arrest the Deputy Governor.
“It is a lie from the pit of hell and a heap of rubbish to mention the name of the Deputy Governor in such a mundane practice of democracy”
“Comrade Philip Shaibu has been in active politics since Nigeria returned to Democracy in 1999 and has never been linked to the issue of an arms deal. In less than 24 hours to the Edo State Governorship election, is it today that Oshiomhole now wants to organize an arrest?
“We are calling on President Buhari and the International community to immediately prevail and call Oshiomhole and his thugs to order to avert unrest that may follow their actions.”
