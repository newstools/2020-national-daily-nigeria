President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki on winning the state governorship election held on Saturday.
In a wide-margin victory, Obaseki, the PDP candidate defeated Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC in the Saturday election whose result was declared by INEC on Sunday.
According to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari commended the management of the election by INEC.
Entitled “President Buhari commends election process in Edo State reiterates commitment to free and fair elections,” the statement quoted Buhari as reiterating his commitment to credible elections.
He urged Obaseki to  show grace and humility in victory.
“My commitment to free and fair elections is firm, because, without free and fair elections, the foundation of our political and moral authority will be weak.
“I have consistently advocated for free and fair elections in the country because it is the bedrock of true democratic order.
“Democracy will mean nothing if the votes of the people don’t count or if their mandate is fraudulently tampered with.”
