The People Democratic Party, PDP, in Edo State on Saturday raised alarm over the alleged invasion of voting units in Urhonigbe North and South wards.
According to the PDP Publicity Secretary in the State, Chris Osa Nehikhare, the APC thugs came in a commando-style, seating on vehicle bonnets and armed with shotguns shooting into the air.
“They collected the ballot boxes and are at this minute thumb printing at the Urhonigbe police station. The police are actively supporting this invasion, snatch and grab operation,” said at the ongoing election.
“We call on the IG of police to call his men to order and INEC to seriously consider the result that will be declared from these two wards in Orhionmwon LGA.
“They scared away voters and INEC staff and seriously injured many,” he alleged.
Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress, APC, has claimed that panic has befallen the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) camp.
According to the APC, the PDP and its candidate in the ongoing election have reportedly started to perceive defeat at the polls.
The APC, in a statement signed by Prince John Mayaki, Chairman, Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, claimed that sources close to the party say that Governor Godwin Obaseki is furious with some of his thugs for not wreaking violence despite the presence of armed forces.
The party quoted its source to have also disclosed that Edo State Deputy Governor, Phillip Shaibu, who was protested against by the people of Jattu in Etsako West on Thursday, had instructed some spies not to decamp from the APC as they would serve as witnesses when the time comes. They plan to suborn the party by giving false testimonies.
