Chairman of the Edo State governorship election National Campaign Council, Governor Nyesom Wike on Thursday reacted to a comment credited to the National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu that residents of Edo state should not vote for Governor Godwin Obaseki because he’s not a true democrat.
Wike in an interview said despite his respect for the Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Tinubu cannot determine if Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki is a democrat or not.
He said only Edo people can determine and decide if they want Governor Obaseki or not.
Wike maintained that without the interference of the Federal government and its agencies, Governor Obaseki will win Saturday’s election squarely.
“I will say it anywhere, Bola Tinubu is one of the politicians I respect highly. Going by what happens in Lagos that one person determines everything, it can be allowed to happen in Edo. You cannot allow that.
“And with all due respect if Bola Tinubu says Obaseki is not a democrat that is his own view. Many of us know that Obaseki is a democrat and it is left for Edo people to determine if Obaseki is a democrat or not.
“If it is by popular voting we can go and sleep knowing that the election is over but because we know that it is not over because they are relying on the federal government that is why I am calling on all Edo persons to take this election as their own contribution to the development of Edo State,” Wike said.
