Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has vowed to punish his erstwhile godfather Adams Oshiomhole and his “lions and tigers” if they continue to misbehave.
Obaseki, who was re-elected on Saturday, said this on Tuesday while appearing on Arise TV.
He stated that there was no plan to “run Oshiomhole out of the state” but noted that how Oshiomhole will be treated depends on his behavior towards his administration.
“I don’t have any plan, but if he continues to behave the way he always does, if he continues to be disruptive, if he continues to fund his lions and tigers, and tries to create problems for us here, then we will not have any mercy.”
Obaseki also speaks on the role of APC National leader Tinubu prior to his re-election as Edo State governor.
Tinubu did a TV broadcast asking the people of Edo to vote out Obaseki on the grounds that he is a dictator.
Reacting to the Tinubu and Oshiomhole partnership to end his governorship ambition, Obaseki said the APC leaders will destroy Nigeria’s democracy if nothing is done to clip their wings.
