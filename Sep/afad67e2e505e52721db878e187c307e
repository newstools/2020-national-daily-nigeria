Rescue team has intensified operations in search of two children washed away by flood in the suburb of Lagos. The two children yet to be identified by the authorities were declared missing at Oyebanjo Street, Ketu, an outskirt of Lagos, after the heavy rainfall that lasted hours last Saturday.
It was gathered that the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency admitted receiving calls when the incident occurred.
The Management Agency was cited to have narrated: “The agency received distress calls concerning the above. On arrival at the scene of the incident, it was discovered that around 8.00p.m., two children had been caught up by flood water.
“A joint team of responders comprising agency responders, LASG Fire Service and LASAMBUS were at the scene. The agency’s Tiger team commenced a search and rescue operation along the path of the floodwater.
“Initial observations revealed a sloping topography with a direct channel of drain water into the canal. This has proven to be rather challenging to navigate.
“Members of the public are urged to exercise extreme caution, particularly, with young children, in flood prone and low-lying areas.”
The Agency maintained that a rescue operation is still going on.
