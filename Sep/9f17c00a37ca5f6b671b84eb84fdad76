Political thugs numbering more than 100 descended on the Ondo House of Assembly Monday, causing panic and swift intervention of the state police command.
Some lawmakers in the assembly are said to be the targets of the gathering attackers who came in vehicles parked along the road leading to the complex.
The assembly was divided after some of the APC controlled house objected to the impeachment of Dep Gov. Ajayi Agboola who defected to the PDP to contest the party primary in the lead-up to the guber election in October.
While the move could not succeed on the floor, Agboola also challenged it in court and won.
APC lawmakers loyal to him have since been at loggerheads with those loyal to Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu.
To head off a recurrence of similar incident in Edo where the state Gov Godwin Obaseki masterminded the destruction of the legislative chamber, men of the Ondo police command moved to the complex and monitored movement in and out.
