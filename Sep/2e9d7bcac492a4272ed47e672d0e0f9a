In a communique at the end of a peace summit in Kafanchan on Sunday, MACBAN identified under-age herders and blockage of grazing routes as the major problems. And these were not issues in the olden days when peace reigned.
“We have agreed to revert to our olden days’ relationship with our neighboring communities in Southern Kaduna,”nthe communique read in part.
“We call on our people to stop allowing underage children from rearing cattle in order to prevent further destruction of the farm produce within the area.
“In the same vein, we call on farmers to desist from blocking cattle routes both local and international,” it added.
They also resolved to epose criminals among them to security agencies.
To cushion the impact of the violence or surviving victims from both sides, MACBAN asks the federal government for compensation.
The communique was jointly signed by the State’s Chairman of the association, Malam Hassan Tugga, Southern Kaduna Zonal Chairman; Malam Abdulhamid Musa; Zonal Secretary, Malam Shuaibu Usman, and Director Media and Publicity, Malam Ibrahim Zango.
Other stakeholders in southern Kaduna were also present.
