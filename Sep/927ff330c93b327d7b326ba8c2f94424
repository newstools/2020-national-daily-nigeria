Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Saturday replies the National leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on a comment credited to him that the Ondo State’s October 10 gubernatorial election is linked to the Southwest bid for the presidency in 2023.
Tinubu had during a meeting with the traditional rulers during the kickoff of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s re-election campaign last Saturday said that ensuring that the APC wins Ondo governorship poll will brightens South-West’s quest to produce Nigeria’s next president.
But in an obvious reply to the former governor during the flag off of the Peoples Democratic Party’s campaign at the MKO Abiola Democracy Park in Akure, the Ondo state capital on Saturday, Makinde said the Ondo election is not about Yoruba’s bid for the 2023 presidency.
“They (APC) said you should vote for them because they want the Presidency to come to Yoruba land. This election is not about the presidency to Yoruba land. This election is about delivering Eyitayo Jegede and putting Ondo state as part of the states that will lead the charge to restructure Nigeria.”
The Oyo State Governor who is the chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the Ondo governorship election also boasted that the PDP will defeat APC in the October 10 election just as he did in Oyo State in the 2019 gubernatorial election.
“We have people, and we have God. In Ondo State, you have God and you have people. It happened in Oyo state, it will happen here,” the Governor said.
