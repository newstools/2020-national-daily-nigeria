Former deputy governor of the CBN and an also-ran in the 2019 presidential election, Dr Obadiah Mailafia, has hit another brickwall in the effort to stop police from investigating him over his remark about a northern governor leading Boko Haram in Nigeria.
Since he blurted out the statement and others during an interview on Nigeria Info in Abuja, the former presidential adviser has been a feature at the DSS office in Jos, and the police is also raring to dig in.
He, however, went to a Jos high court to halt the police invitation.
But on Tuesday, the court dismissed the application.
Nigerians have called on Mailafia to open up if he is actually as patriotic as he said during the interview.
Mailafia had boasted he was ready to lay down his life for the voiceless in the southern Kaduna and others across the nation reeling in throes of insecurity.
He has however been screaming in the media how his life has been at stake since the DSS started inviting him.
