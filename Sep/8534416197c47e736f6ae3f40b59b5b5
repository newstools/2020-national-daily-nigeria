President Muhamamdu Buhari on Monday extended the tenure of the Presidential Investigative Panel probing allegations of impropriety against former acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, to six weeks.
It was gathered that Chairman of the panel, Justice Ayo Salami, had requested to travel to the United Kingdom (UK) to “investigate” the case of a former Minister of Petroluem Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke, accused of gross financial misappropriation.
There was an insinuation that in an alleged plot to implicate Magu, there is plan to invite the former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, to testify in the investigation of Magu.
