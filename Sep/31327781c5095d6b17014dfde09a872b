While the best weight loss solution involves patience, determination, and resilience, combined with a proper diet plan, exercise, and lifestyle alterations, there are a few shortcuts that you can implement if you need to lose weight.
Honey and Lime
Consuming honey with lime is recommended for weight loss. Honey with lemon and warm water is a good way to start your day. Honey can play a role in weight loss in naturopathy.
Green Tea
Green tea is known to contain a powerful antioxidant named epigallocatechin gallate (ECG). This antioxidant is known to stimulate the fat-burning process in the body, as found by researchers Kao, Hiipakka, and Liao from the University of Chicago, US.
So, it is highly encouraged to consume daily and is often recommended in weight loss programs.
Drink Water
We all get thirsty, but sports drinks, sugary juices, and alcohol only add to extra calories to our diet and do not provide us with any nutritional benefits. Eliminate them from your diet and switch to water.
Ideally, a person should drink 2-3 liters of water daily. It boosts your metabolic rate and increases urination, which helps you lose more water weight and prevents water retention. It is important to note that if you have been told by your Physician to restrict fluids due to heart and kidney complications, you should follow medical advice.
Increase your Vegetable Intake
Vegetables, unlike white processed foods, are made up of complex carbohydrates, which means they take longer to digest, leaving you feeling full and satisfied.
Researcher Charlotte Erlanson-Albertsson, in a 2015 report published in Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands), stated that thylakoid found in spinach can curb cravings and suppress hunger which can further help in weight loss.
Eliminate Refined Grains or Processed Food
Anything made of refined grain is going to make you gain weight because it is composed mainly of sugar and carbohydrates, both of which are quickly digested. They also leave you feeling unsatisfied, with a propensity to eat even more. These empty calories are the opposite of what you should consume to lose weight fast!
Drink Coffee Before a Workout
While some personal trainers might not suggest this as the best option, if you are trying to lose weight, the caffeine will give you an extra boost of energy, pushing you to work out a bit harder and longer, burning out a couple of hundred extra calories with each workout.
Switch from Sugar to Honey
Instead of sugar, it is advisable to switch to honey. Honey contains fructose and glucose in nearly equal proportions and it does not add too many calories to the body. Note that it is still important to limit the amount of honey being used as it contains 17 grams of sugar per tablespoon.

Smaller Meals at Regular Intervals
 
 
 
Researcher Heather J Leidy, from the University of Missouri, Columbia, has stated in a research paper published in the Journal of Nutrition, that eating in small quantities at regular intervals increases metabolism, improves glucose and insulin control, and reduces hunger and eventually body weight.
 
Eat Slowly
 
People who eat slowly and mindfully consume fewer calories and don’t suffer from obesity nearly as often. Slow down your eating time, allowing your stomach to digest and feel full throughout the meal, which will help you only consume what your body actually needs.
 
Get Enough Sleep
 
Your body needs a certain amount of sleep, and when it doesn’t attain its optimal amount, it will try to satisfy that lack of other things, such as craving food. Furthermore, if you sleep well, you’ll be more likely to be active during the day, less likely to skip the gym, and less prone to go for a high-sugar energy-boosting meal to give you that extra push.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mushrooms
 
Mushrooms are often turned to as a meat substitute because they can fill a similar role in your diet. They are in fact a low-calorie and low-fat alternative. Studies have shown that people who replace meat with mushrooms even once a week show significant weight loss in a short period of time.
 
 
 
Avoid Sodas and Diet Drinks
 
 
 
Many people have the habit of drinking soda when they are thirsty. Sodas contain added sugars, which add to your weight. Even diet sodas contain sugar in smaller quantities.
 
Instead, it is advisable to drink other liquids, such as water, lime or lemon water. Avoiding carbonated drinks is often a very important tip in any weight loss regime.
