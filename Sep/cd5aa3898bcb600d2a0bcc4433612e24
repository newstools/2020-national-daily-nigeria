The Edo State chapter of the APC has rejected the just concluded election in the state on certain grounds, but it has advised its members to stay calm while the leadership decides the next step.
In a statement sent to DAILY POST by the Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, the party listed violence, result manipulation, and harassment among the reason it won’t accept the election outcome.
“Our people were arbitrarily arrested, many of the figures were fabricated.
“Areas where we won, they cancelled them. They decreased the votes in areas we had advantage.
“They rejected our results and jerked up theirs.”
He also alleged that there was an arbitrary arrest of local party members, who could have resisted the outrage, while the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki was busy allegedly “diverting attention with false alarm.
“Obaseki shouted that he was being rigged out and blamed INEC at the initial stage but that was to divert attention from the evil going on in the field”, the statement said
In the election Obaseki defeat the APC candidate Osagie Ize Iyamu with over 60000 votes
