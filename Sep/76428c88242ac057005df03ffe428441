Big Brother has issued a second strike to Ozo for infringement of house rules regarding communication over the love notes he wrote to profess his feelings for Nnegi.

While addressing the housemates over this weekâ€™s wager and their behavior, Big Brother played a clip where Ozo was seen writing the love notes before he handed it over to Nengi.

He warned other housemates against writing secret messages before issuing Ozo his second strike, meaning if he gets another strike, he is out of the show via disqualification.
