Governor Godwin Obaseki has finally opened up on the reason why he parted ways with former governor of the state, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.
Obaseki who disclosed this while addressing party faithful in wards 8 and 10, Egor Local Government Area, said one of the reasons is his reversal of the sale of Edaiken Market, which Oshiomhole sold to his friends.
According to the governor, Oshiomhole sold Edaiken Market to his friends who charged exorbitant rates that were beyond the reach of traders who needed the lock-up shops.
“I reversed the sale of Edaiken Market and brought the rates down to the level that our people can afford. That pitted me against the godfather. He said that I cannot be a Governor. Is he God? Are we fools?
“If you come, do your own, and if another person comes, allow him to play his own part and leave. That man (Oshiomhole) is very dangerous. See the party they put under his watch he has destroyed it. This fight is between Oshiomhole and me. The fight is not between me and Ize-Iyamu.
“We will bury Oshiomhole politically. We have retired him and on September 19, 2020, we will bury him politically.”
He expressed optimism that he will defeat Oshiomhole in the gubernatorial election, including in Oshiomhole’s Ward 10 in Etsako West Local Government Area of the state.
He assured Edo people with their votes for the PDP, will on September 19, 2020, render the sacked national Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) politically irrelevant.
The governor assured that the forthcoming gubernatorial election will put an end to godfatherism in the state, urging voters to come out en masse to vote for the PDP to enable him consolidate on his achievements in the first term.
