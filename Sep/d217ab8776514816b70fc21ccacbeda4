Two top English premiership side, Chelsea and Manchester United are in stiff competition to sign on West Ham United midfielder, Declan Rice before the transfer window closes this summer.
While Manchester United is yet to make its bid public, the Blues are ready to offer West Ham €45 million in a bid to land Rice, 21, at Stamford Bridge.
However, if both clubs reach an agreement for Rice before the transfer window closes next month, Frank Lampard’s side will offer the England international a five-year contract that will see him stay at the West London club until 2025.
According to respected sports journalist and transfer expert, Nicolo Schira, Chelsea are in talks for Declan Rice, and ready to offer €45M to West Ham to sign the midfielder.
“If two clubs reach an agreement, Rice will sign a 5-year contract.”
It would be recalled that Rice who has a reported price tag of around £75 million, had drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past few weeks.
Rice began his career at Chelsea, but the latter joined West Ham after he was let go by the Premier League giants as a teenager.
