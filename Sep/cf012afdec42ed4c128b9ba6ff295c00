The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State has raised fresh alarm alleging that highly placed sources craving anonymity have cried out against the appearance of state civil servants impersonating National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members in Owan West, Owan East and Akoko-Edo Local Government Areas of Edo State.
The party alleged that one of the sources disclosed that only few corps members turned up for the election duty and that at least 30% of the people currently undergoing training are, in fact, state civil servants who have graduated over five years ago.
APC added that “the source categorically stated that it was the PDP’s handiwork, as the same had occurred in Oredo Local Government Area, where 300 corps members were trained, who did not apply through the portal.
“This mission of the agents, it was disclosed, is to perpetuate the governor’s anti-democratic agenda during the elections.”
Chairman of Edo APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki in a statement decried: “The governor plans to rig elections. They have been looting Edo into poverty to furnish this dark plan to rig the election. It is bad enough that the governor has chosen this path of destruction. He is destroying only himself. He has tried his best to debilitate the state by insulting the security agencies, the judiciary, the Palace, prominent sons and daughters of Edo, the office of the governor, and now the National Youth Service Corps. He now impersonates youths from other states to rig elections!”
Mayaki also called on citizens in the state and the INEC to be at alert to the caprices of the state government and PDP.
“We condemn this unwholesome development and call on INEC and other bodies with election supervisory mandate to prevail on the emerging rigging style of the PDP. All Edo citizens must be vigilant to quell any attempts to pilfer their mandates,” Mayaki declared.
