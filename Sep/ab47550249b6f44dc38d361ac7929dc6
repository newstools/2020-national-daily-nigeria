Crisis rocking Plateau State chapter of the Peoples’ Democratic Party took another dimension yesterday, as a group of party members loyal to Senator Jeremiah Useni disassociates itself from the Congress that took place on Saturday that produced Chris Hassan as State Chairman.

Speaking during a Stakeholders meeting, Senator Jeremiah Useni explained that a reconciliation committee made up of three members each from the two groups was constituted by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State to reconcile both groups, only for Senator Jonah Jang group to go ahead with the Congress.

He emphasised that his group will also produce its own officials to run the affairs of the Party.

Useni alleged that the National leadership of the Party was supporting the other group, describing their action as unfortunate.

Other members of the group made up of past state and National elected officers of the party expressed support for Senator Useni, stressing that they will not leave the party.

They all agreed to take all necessary action towards finding a logical conclusion to the challenges facing the party.

Meanwhile, Mr. Chris Hassan has emerged as the factional Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party in Plateau State at a State Congress of the party held in Jos.

Announcing the result, Chairman of the State Congress Election Committee Major General Amnon Kwasbebe rtd said Hassan pulled 1,649 votes to defeat 3 other candidates.

Hassan was Vice Chairman Plateau North of the Party and one time Commissioner for works in the State.

Other positions are Deputy Chairman Captain Bitrus Golen, Secretary, Emmanuel Tuang and John Akans was elected Public Relations Officer.

Over 1,600 delegates across the State participated in the Congress, with over 42 candidates boycotting the exercise citing irregularities in certain processes for their action.
