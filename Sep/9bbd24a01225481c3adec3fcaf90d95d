The elders expressed hope that the emergence of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC as the next Governor of Edo State would herald a new beginning and spark positive changes and development in their community.
Chairman of the Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, in a statement in Benin City on Thursday, indicated that receiving Ize-Iyamu, the Odionwele of Iruekpen, Pa Akhabue Isesele, on behalf of the elders, painted the grim picture of the community’s poor infrastructure. According to Mayaki, he appealed to the APC candidate to improve the operations of the Police by providing a befitting building for the Divisional Police Headquarters within the community, and ensure steady electricity supply by facilitating a stable connection to the national grid if he is elected as Governor on the 19th of September.
The Odionwele also pleaded with Ize-Iyamu to carry out a renovation of the magistrate court destroyed by unknown hoodlums 10 years ago to facilitate quick dispensation of justice.
The elders were said to have prayed for Ize-Iyamu’s success at the polls and advised him to abide by the promises contained in his documented manifesto, the SIMPLE Agenda, to move the State forward and restore inclusive governance.
Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu expressed he was overwhelmed by the prayers and advice of the elders of Iruekpen community. He promised to provide solutions to their expressed concerns and exceed their performance expectations if elected as the next Governor of the State.
