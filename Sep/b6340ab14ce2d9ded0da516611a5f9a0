After an all-night performance at a studio in the Alagbado area of Lagos, two musicians lay dead and their studio manager unconscious as concerned neighbours later found out on Thursday.
The noise of the facility’s running generator moved the curious neighbors to break into the building when there no sign of people using the generator.
The neighbors not only recovered the dead bodies, but also hard drugs, condoms and other items.
The police were later alerted and the dead were evacuated while the unconscious  and two other survivors were taken to hospital for medical attention.
According to a police report, the studio manager, identified as Muritala Azeez, who was stabilised in the hospital, was already interrogated.
Ajibawo Lawal, 37, and Sunday Akhigbe, 12, were met inside the studio dead, the repot said.
“A search was conducted inside the studio and the generator, condoms, bread and food that the deceased vomited and substances suspected to be hard drugs, including Indian hemp were found in the studio.
“Meanwhile, one Muritala Azeez, the owner of the studio, who is already in custody, admitted to having hired and kept them there and identified them as artistes who produce music for him. He further stated that he was with them physically on the previous night and later on the phone with them until 2am of September 3.”
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Muyiwa Adejobi, confirmed the incident, noting that investigations were ongoing.
