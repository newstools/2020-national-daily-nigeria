Obaseki, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the rounding up campaign in Oredo Local Government, was of the view that the former Edo governor wants to be dictating who gets what election ticket for the incumbent governor. He, therefore, said that the September 19 is about contesting with Oshiomhole, adding that the former APC chairman failed to respect Benin people.
Governor Obaseki had declared: “As a sitting Governor, Oshiomhole decides to pick who will represent me in my House of Assembly. Can you imagine the insult? That was where this fight started.
“Because he believes, in his own mind, that Benin people are like chickens – when you throw corn, they will run after the corn.
“This election is a contest with Oshiomhole. We have dealt with him at the national level, we will bury him politically in this election; because he has no regard for Benin people, he has no regard for us in Oredo, and we will show him that he is nothing.”
Oshiomhole was suddenly removed as APC national chairman within about 48 hours Obaseki was disqualified by the screening committee from contesting the APC primary election for the party governorship ticket.
Oshiomhole is supporting Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, APC candidate for the September 19 election.
