There appears to be rising apprehension and suspicion in Benin City as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) proceeded on  two hours break on Sunday morning after announcing results of the governorship election in Edo State in 16 of the 18 local government areas in which incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki maintained comfortable lead. The results from Orhionmwon and Ovia south west were still pending before the two hours break.
The apprehension arose from the fear of suspicion of pressure on the electoral umpire to manipulate figures of the results in Orhionmwon, Ovia south west to alter the pendulum of the electoral victory. It was said that the two local governments have large number of voters in the states.
Meanwhile, the results of the Edo governorship election in the Governor Obaseki is in the lead, are as follows:
